okay, so good morning everyone. 
talk about CP violation in B decays. 
okay. so first a brief introduction. 
we know CP violating 
um observed in K, B and D meson decays, 
and uh they are well consistent with CP uhs 
standard model prediction, 
but uh 
um... 
they are still too small to explain the absence of anti-matter in the in the universe. 
um... this slide will 
will will shuw the 
two analysis one is about lambda B to p three pion, the other is B to three pion decays. 
for the unitary triangles measurements, please see talk from Mark tomorrow. 
um... about lambda b to p three pion decays. 
the previous measurements shows uh 
three point three sigma for CPV using the triple product asymmetries. 
um this measurement performed uh 
in the regions of phase smace. 
so we will update it with more data set to see if this is true or due to uh statistical fluctuation. 
for uh for the new analysis of this decay uh is updated using six point six inverse feta, inverse feta bar data. 
and about twenty-seven 
thousand 
uh 
yields observed which is about four times than the previous 
and uh two approaches are 
are exploited. one is triple product asymmetry use 
with improved binning schemes. the other is unbinned energy test method. 
You can uh see the clear signal 
uh on the right plot. 
um the triple products are constructed 
in the mother particle rest frame 
and... using um... 
momenta of um... 
of final three particles 
uh in the lambda b rest frame, or or the lambda b bar rest frame using the corresponding anti particles. 
and then we can um construct the P-odd asymmetries 
by comparing 
uh the 
different sign of the C T for the lambda b decay, and correspondingly 
um compare 
comparing the the the signals with different sign of the of the C T bar for the lambda b bar decays. 
after that we can construct the 
CP violating or the P violating observable observables 
as the difference or the sum of the of the CAT and A T bar. 
that's showin on 
on the 
red or the blue boxe. 
um 
so, how to... to get the improved um binning schemes. 
first we 
um... deve- developed an amplitude modes based on these two theoretical papers 
uh and 
and then we can introduce 
um... 
so, so first we have model which 
which is can reproduce a similar phase space distributions as data observed from the 
previous measurements, then we'll introduce the P-odd CP violation. 
that might from could from the the uh S and P wave interference as showin in the following decay chains. 
um the lambda b to N star plus one half and uh N star plus three half 
the phase space region of this decay allows uh 
for 
many N star plus and delta plus. 
so, this 
this model 
actually is is an 
approximation of the nature. 
so, we can do 
uh sensitivity studies 
based on use using this model. 
with this uh 
model 
we have uh 
uh new improved the scheme A 
which which 
uh is for the phase space division in the 
polar 
and the azimuth angles 
of the pruton in the Delta plus plus rest frame, 
or or the Delta plus plus in the N star plus rest frame. 
uh... 
we also have a scheme B 
which is uh 
which is 
based on the 
absolute value of the pha- 
Phi angle 
defi uh 
defined by the two decay plans. 
we keep it p- 
we use it because this is uh 
uh this is this is the same as the previous measurements we want to check if the symmetries are still there. 
so, 
uh 
for the uh phase space integrated measurements, 
the a CP is consistent with CP symmetry you can see from the top, 
then the the AP um variables, 
there is about five point five sigma deviation from the pip p symmetry. 
there's p 
parity violation here. 
for the measurements in the different region of phase space, the sample first split into... two samples. 
sample A 
uh is for the A one resonance dominated events, 
sample two is for the multiple N star dominated events. 
as you can see from plots, the first two plots are for the A one 
top two plots, then the bo bottom two plots are for the N star plots, 
dominant events. 
uh the the red point is for the ACP oberservations and the, um blue um points 
for the AP measurements. 
um there's no evidence for the CP validation, 
the highest significance is about two point nine sigma, 
as you can see 
in the 
um... 
scheme B 
on the right uh bottom right plot. 
so for the energy test, um 
energy test is a model-independent unbinned test, which is sensitive to the local difference between two samples, 
which might 
um... 
might from the CP uh violation. 
the statistical test is uh about 
three terms the first two terms are 
calculation 
uh in two samples separately 
and the third is for calculation between two samples. 
the weighted function uh... has two parameters. The d parameter is the distance between two candidates in 
the samples, uh which is determined by in the space determined by the decay topology 
and delta is a distance scale can be optimized from the Monte Carlo. 
the total sample um are divided into four sub sub samples according to the transformation under the 
charge and parity transformation. 
so, we can do um the P-odd CP test by comparing sample one four versus sample two three. 
uh and also P-even CP test by comparing sample one two versus sample three four. 
and also we can do 
parity test. 
by comparing sample one three and the sample two four. 
um 
so from the Monte Carlo we have. 
um we 
we we can have three kinds of delta values, 
then do 
the test uh uh shown in the first uh in the previous slide. 
for the um P-even CP conservation test 
as shuwn in the blue box. 
um... 
the highest significance is about three point zero sigma 
corresponding to a delta value equal uh to two point seven. 
um... 
after combine these three measurements, the significance is less than three sigma. 
so unfortunately, here there is no um... evidence confirmed. 
for for the P conservash conservation test. 
uh the the first two test um has more than five sigma. 
and when combine all three measurements 
um the... 
the parity test is about 
three point five point three deviation from the parity conservation. 
so, here's the 
parity violation here. 
uh about B to three pi decays, 
the previous analysis shuw, 
shuws um 
ruw symmetry localized in regions of Dalitz Plots as you can see from plot, 
the cost 
the colors 
pres- 
um... for the different values of of the asymmetry. 
uh which may came f- came from the low mass s-wave contribution and the rho interference, 
or the rho omega mixing, all pi pi KK rescattering. 
so, an amplitude analysis is neededed to find the correct source of the CPA. 
uh for the amplitude analysis the, 
models models are 
built 
separately for B plus and B minus. 
and they are two kinds of 
parameters the C is uh... complex coefficiency for the CP violating and F is uh 
strong damanics dynamics part, 
to contains the lineshape and the angular distributions 
and is CP conservi- conserving part. 
um... there are three different methods to describe the S wave contributions, the isobar model, K-matrix and the 
uh quasi model independent approach. 
and then we construct two observables, the... 
ACP for the CP violating the violating measurements by comparing the 
squared uh the uh coefficients 
and the fit fraction as uh 
the integral of each contributions, 
so 
um... about 
twenty uh thou- 
thousand remains signals constructed using three inverse f ba data. 
and you can see that there's different structures in the 
uh dalitz plot. 
obviuously the red box 
corresponding to um to 
uh the low resonance, 
or might rho omega mixing here. 
and also there's um 
f two 
probably in in in in in the plots. 
and also might uh pi pi KK resca- rescattering. 
so, 
from the uh numerical results, 
we can see that the dominant contributions are from the rho seven seventy, which is about to uh fifty fifty-five percent. 
and S-wave about twenty-five percent. 
um there are larger CP violation from 
f 
f two twelve seventy, about forty five percent 
and uh... from the s-wave about 
uh fourteen percent. 
but 
there's no asymmetry from the rho seven seventy which's large contribution in the decays. 
um... 
three uh pu- 
both three uh methods uh 
uh gi- uh gives give the consistent results. 
for the uh rho seven seventy's, 
um... 
if you look at the asymmetries projections in the the 
uh cosine theta helice dangles and also the mass. 
um there are small very small asymmetries almost consistent with zero. 
but um... 
if we look at the asymmetry projections, 
um beluw, 
and above the rho mass, 
you can see the clear asymmetries 
and asymmetry change the signs a crossing mass, 
cross rho mass. 
if you put them together the asymmetries can sign perfect. 
um... 
this uh 
characteristic pattern is due to the S P wave interference, 
uh which proportional to the cosine seet um helicity. 
so when uh integral over this angle, 
as- asymmetry vanishes. that's why we cannot see the asymmetries for the integrated measurements. 
um... 
and also we'll find uh a first observation for a 
uh a CPV in the process involving intense f two twelve seventy 
you can see the larger 
uh... 
from the from the plot. 
a large plot 
CP asymmetry uh can go to forty percent 
and... 
there there's uh 
a lit a small discre ancy 
bet- between between the mode and the data in the mass of the f two. 
uh afters some systematic studies the 
this CP violation here is rebust. 
uh for the s-wave um results, 
um... 
these three approaches are well in good agreement. 
and if you look at the um the 
left top left plots 
for the squared amplitude 
magnitude 
um... 
if you look at the um 
top right plot, this is the phase of amplitude model. 
um... 
the the phase is hard to describe 
because due to different assumptions here 
and also 
here is clear that you can see the 
there's no 
uh f zero fifteen hundred are in the isobar model. 
uh and also the this comparison can be made by... 
by seplit B plus and and and the B minus. 
so as shuwn in the bottom three plots, 
um... 
is clear that 
there are's 
similar CPV pattern for these three approaches. 
like, uh for example, the, 
the there's larger asymmetries in the low mass region. 
and uh the uh asymmetries change sign 
when the... 
pi pi mass goes to 
one GeV which is co- a corresponding to f zero nine eighty 
and also the 
and started to change a sign um from if mass larger than one GeV. 
so, um 
so there is last page, the summary. 
so, um these multiple decays are an interesting place to search for CP violation, 
um because the rich phase space structures allow, allow to, 
to... 
to improve the sensitivity for CPV 
uh and parity violation uh observed in Lambda b to p three pion decays. 
but uh 
um... 
we didn't confirm the evidence of CP violation. 
so the more data are needed to do the further studies 
um... and we found the 
um... 
several sources of CPV in B to three pion decays. 
the new CPV pattern 
uh of the rho seven seventy's 
and the CPV pros- in 
found in process was a, was a tensum, 
tensor f two twelve seventy 
and uh... CPV in the S-wave contributions in in the low mass regions. 
that's all. 
thank you. 
Thank you very much Jinlin, was very clear. 
um... um... 
for... questions, so uh 
uh from uh... 
raise your hand 
on the application, if possible, if you can't 
put 
uh a comment in the chat. and we'll try to 
get you to speak at the right moment. 
so there any question? for the speaker at this time 
maybe to start 
since I don't see any hand. I have a comment on the first analysis on lambda b. 
um... 
sorry 
your first paper 
using the same channel that you publishe on... 
in nature, no? 
yes 
you publish the evidence 
for CP violation and know 
nothing, let's say for P violation. now you use uh 
a same qualities partially correlated with the first one, and 
you have a bit less than three sigma for CP violation, I don't think is the issue 
since you moved from three point 
what was three point three to to to something, let's let's things, it is not can be of course, 
uh due to the statistics, but you have now five point five sigma for the P violation. 
so I have uh... 
a a couple of questions. so 
did you check the compatibility for these two uh... 
two analyses that that use the same 
final state? 
uh for example, you 
may be you did not 
okay, you you could try to to perform the old analysis on the new data set the total sample that you use now 
or vice versa in order in order to see if you have agreement or not since 
moving from uh no evidence to five point five sigma for violation, I think that is a bit 
a bit strange. 
uh... actually, we did comparisons for um separately for for the the first sample of, 
and the second samples 
um... also applied the... 
uh... the same 
the same selections. 
um... 
we found actually there's uh 
there's about two two point six uh 
sigma 
uh consistent between two 
two uh... 
two uh... 
two samples. 
so we think that um 
this due to the... sense- 
statistical fluctuation for the CP violation. 
but for for the parity violation, uh uh we think that this is due to the 
we have the larger 
um... 
statistics, 
so we can find 
that it's it is about five point five 
sig- uh sigma deviation. 
okay, thank you. 
I would have a question if I can. 
yes Luccia go ahead 
uh yeah so this is more referred to the second measurement, you sa you show so... 
uh... B to 
uh three pions. 
so e- e- 
it's great 
uh... to observe 
a new sources of uh CP violation. 
uh my question 
about these is, 
can you get uh... 
any CKM information from this 
decays? 
uh... 
I don't think so because here is um 
the phase tha- 
actually is associated with resonance 
or... or... 
or... rescattering. 
so, in this kind of level, I don't think 
it's directed to the CKM angles. 
cause when when when you construct the amplitudes, 
um... 
when construct the amplitudes actually this is on the hadron... level. 
so, 
the the phase uh 
is not direct to the skim angle. 
okay, thanks. 
okay, there are no other... 
burning questions so we'll move to the next talk. so we're still on time. 
all right, thanks. 
perfect, we can see we can see your slides, you can start. thank you. 
okay, so I'll be uh covering uh couplings and mass measurements in the ZZ and WW channels from both ATLAS and CMS. 
uh so start with the ZZ to four lepton decay channel, which is of course one of the workhorse channels for Higgs physics. uh 
it has a very low branching ratio of about point oh one percent. but uh 
because of the uh the high purity in the mass peak where the signal background ratio is about two it's very useful for 
measuring the Higgs boson properties. 
and in the full run to sample ATLAS and CMS both have now about two hundred signal ents. 
so this plot here of the m four l distribution 
uh selection shows the uh 
the single peak and the three main backgrounds so the 
dominant background comes from standard model ZZ star production, which can either be 
estimated from the Monte Carlo uh, or the normalization of it can be constrained using the m four l sidebands. 
uh the background from lepton fakes and heavy flavor decayses 
estimated uh in a data driven fashion and back the remaining small backgrounds from 
uh ttV and similar uh and vvv can 
be estimated from Monte Carlo, or or constrained in the sidebands. so, particularly in the cases where uh, 
where these are relevant, such as for trying to look at ttH production. 
uh so, I'll start with the Higgs boson mass, which is the one property we measure that it's not a test of the standard model 
because of course uh, the Higgs boson is a free parameter. 
uh so this plot here is just a reminder of why we're interested because the production in this case the production of ttH, 
uh uh does depend on the mass. and uh if we want to be able to test the standard model 
precisely we we do need to know the value the mass precisely as well. 
and of course four-lepton channel is a good channel for measuring mass because uh the um 
a- all its final state and all final state particles are fully reconstructed and the uh 
the resolution 
with which we can measure the lepton uh energies is pretty good. 
uh sume-, 
this uh mesh- to ATLAS has now carried out first uh mass measurement using the full run two dassa. 
uh su it starts by recovering any FSR part uh photons and then 
constraining the mass of the leading lepton pair to be the Z mass, which 
gives a gain of about fifteen percent resolution, 
uh then the the resulting m four l distribution is 
parameterized the double sided crystal ball function in each of the analysis categories, 
uh which are based on the final state, which gives you a rough resolution 
splitting because muons have a better resolution than electrons and a BDT that's used 
to separate the e signal from the dominant ZZ background. 
and background shapes are taken from smooth Monte Carlo and their normalization is allowed to float 
uh and the resulting fit uh, 
the fit is performed in each category and then this plot just adds up all the 
the categories to show uh 
to show the uh final result. 
uh William sorry, maybe you can move to fullscreen, our bercause Tony is live cause we see also stuff around. 
oh, sorry. 
yeah. 
is that better? 
yeah. 
thank you. 
okay. 
polies. 
um 
so we can also um 
because the stats are still fairly low, 
uh, 
we can gain from uh from using the per vent 
m four l resolution. 
uh... 
so this uh, 
this gives roughly an improvement of about two percent 
uh in the final result, and it's it also uh means that the 
result is somewhat more robust to fluctuations due to the low stats. 
uh the problem course is how to obtain this the lepton optimal resolution is 
intradicly non Gaussian and also the constraint on the leading lepton pair means that the two leading lepton uh 
lepton four vectors become correlated. 
uh so rather than trying to uh to calculate the m four l resolution directly from the lepton resolutions 
in the events, we train a neural network to predict it 
by using the information In each of the leptons and event level information. 
so in the upper left here, we just show a plot of the 
predicted resolution 
uh for data and Monte Carlo. 
and as I said, this gives a small small but non non trivial again to the uh final resolution. 
and so the final result is shown here, uh for each of the four final states and then combined, 
uh you can compare to the previous CMS four l result it agrees fairly well, 
this is about a twenty percent improvement on the previous ATLAS result and, 
we are still stat dominated here with 
the leading systematic being the uh muon momentum scale. 
okay, so moving on to couplings measurements, uh this is the simplified template cross section framework. 
so, I show a sort of schematic of what this looks like 
in the upper left. 
uh so these attempt to target 
um... 
specific phase space regions within production modes, so you start by splitting by production modes, 
and then you do further splits uh using the standard model as a kinematic template so, 
by the number of jets the PT of associated vector bosons uh or or whatever uh. 
uh so that the the general idea is to try to maximize the experimental 
sensitivity while simultaneously minimizing the uh the the dependence on theorecal uncertainties. 
uh and so to to measure uh the the cross section in these bins, uh reconstructed 
categories are defined to to target them. and so in the upper right is uh the the CMS plot showing how they did this 
on the y axis are the various reconstructed categories they defined. 
and the x axis shows the uh the fraction of each of the uh uh truth 
STXS bins 
that fell into the categories. 
um 
so, the the two experiments do use different uh diff- definitions of STXS, 
both starting from the so called stage one but then with some bins merged uh, 
but with different uh a bin mergings ta talk in a moment, 
and then the cross sections uh in each bin are extra 
by fitting simply to to the values uh obtained in the reconstructed categories. 
uh so the two experiments have s- 
somewhat diffinent proaches to uh to trying to define their categories uh, C- CMS uses these kinematic 
discriminants to try to enrich the uh 
the categories in particular signals. 
uh so 
each in each of these plots the the signal is being targeted is uh in the darker pink while 
the background signal is in the lighter pink, 
and then the the cut value uh is 
on is uh the the dash gray line. 
uh the variable it's cu- being cut on is thi- 
this kinematic discriminant, uh which is defined 
uh similarly for... for in each case as a 
one over uh one plus the ratio of the uh... the 
the probability of Higgs production based on 
uh the the kinematics in the events 
divided the probability of the the production that's being targeted. 
uh so in the two plots on the right the targeted production is VBF, 
in the top two 
with two jets in the bottom with one jet. 
plot on the left, the targeted production is VH. 
you can see that that by uh 
by imposing a cut on this variable you can uh obtain. 
uh categories relatively enriched in the the signal you're interested in compared to 
other signals and uh to the backgrounds. 
uh so ATLAS has a 
different approach which uses fewer categories, to try to reduce the migrations between them, 
uh but instead a mi- to 
uh trains neural networks and then fits on the neural network distributions within the categories 
to try to uh maintain sensitivity. 
uh so this the example that I show here uh is in the two jet category. 
uh so thi- this category is uh split by uh 
um 
using the value of the uh a neural network that's trained to 
to distinguish uh VH production. uh see you can see on the left is the uh 
is the the the low is 
the lower falue of this neural network, which then in turn is divided 
into bins based on a neural network that's trying to distinguish VBF production 
on the right is uh 
is the VH enriched category which is then used 
which is then again fur subdivided in the values of this VH neural network. 
um... 
so that the final fit then uses these uh these distributions to uh to improve the sensitivity. 
so results su- shown here for both ATLAS on left and CMS on the right. 
uh because of the different bin mergings, I tried to uh indicate 
which uh 
CMS bins correspond to which ATLAS bins, uh though do note that 
uh ggZH production is included in the ATLAS gg two H categories. 
uh whereas for CMS, it's included in VH. uh so the correspondence between them is not uh quite exact. 
uh 
but good agreement with Standard Model is observed uh pretty much in all cases. 
and uh... I want advertise here that 
uh there will be a talk on Friday which will include EFT interpretations of of these results. 
so moving on now to the WW uh to a llnunu decay channel. 
uh this is just an event display showing uh what what this what one uh 
sample uh event looks like um 
with the the electron and muon and then then a missing energy uh clearly visible and transverse the event. 
uh 
so, this decay channel has a much higher backgrounds than the four lepton channel uh, 
sorry much higher branching ration four lepton channel 
about one percent compared to point oh one percent. but of course, this oes come 
with higher backgrounds 
and also uh the disadvange of final state is not fully reconstructed. 
uh so the, it's uh difficult to to do a STXS stage one measurements but still uh possible for a stage zero. 
um 
so, the uh the plot here shows uh 
the transverse mass distribution uh, 
which is 
proximation of the uh 
of the Higgs mass taking into account the the missing energy and the uh 
four vectors of 
the leptons 
uh and 
shows the the the uh the various backgrounds so, the leading background is from Standard Model WW production 
uh for ATLAS this is contrain in a separate control region. 
uh CMS performs they're fit uh 
not just to the one M T variable, but uh two dimensionally using also mll. 
the the massive the two leptons, 
uh in which case the uh WW background is constrained directly as part of the fit! 
uh top quark and Drell-Yan backgrounds uh are 
constrained by their own control regions. 
uh the non-WW diboson background from the ZZ or Z gamma is constrained by uh 
by control regions or estimate from Monte Carlo 
depending a bit on 
nalysis. and finally, there is the Misidentified lepton backgrounds which are estimated from data. 
uh so, I'll be focusing mainly on uh a VH production 
uh as an example of how the alsynos this works. 
uh so, for for the uh case of WH they're essentially two categories, 
one in which the two leptons that have the same flavor are on opposite sides. 
uh this is shown on the left and the top 
is the uh the CMS plot and the bottom a ATLAS. 
uh the so two experiments have different approaches CMS here uses the uh 
minimum value of the delta RLL between the oppositely charged leptons 
as uh, as it's a uh 
sensitive variable, 
whereas ATLAS has a BDT's that attempt to uh to to obtain better signal to background rejection. 
uh so in the case of opposite signs same flavor the dominant background is WC 
uh wich is shown in yellow and and a top auts from CMS and purple in the bottom plots from ATLAS. 
uh for the same sam sign, flavor pair the 
is less background uh mo- mainly coming from uh from the top uh production or from nonprompt fleptons. 
um... 
so again, in the top is the uh the plot versus the minimum value of delta RLL. 
uh while on the bottom are the uh, the 
is uh the um 
is the at ATLAS plot using uh the BDTS in this case, 
separate BDTS uh in fact two BDTS which to traines to distinguish uh between each of the uh the the two leading backgrounds. 
um and then uh uh 
the uh the the two dimensional uh pal- is just unfolded into uh 
a one d pot to uh, 
to make it easier to to see. 
in the CH category uh, this phone is 
um more pure, but the stats are quite low. 
um 
this case the 
the split is on the number of uh same flavor opposite sign lepton pairs. 
um... 
only one, then uh the uh the purity is higher. if you have 
two, then the ZZ background uh starts become uh a a larger issues you can see in the plot on the top right. 
uh but uh because the stats are too so low uh 
and bo- both experiments, this is uh simply done as a cut and count uh experiment. 
and finally, a CMS also attempts to target uh 
the case where the uh associated vector boson decays hadronically to two jets. 
uh this gives you a higher branching ratio. uh but of course the background that increases quite a bit 
uh dominantly from tW and the tt bar. 
uh so in case the uh the the requirement is that the jets should be central uh to allow them to to allow b tagging 
uh to reject uh the the tW and tt bar backgrounds. 
and uh the the the variable used in this case is the dilepton mass mll 
can see the plot on the lower left uh the the dominant uh 
uh backgrounds in yellow. 
so moving on to results in the upper left is a the uh, 
uh the 
measurements in each of the uh different uh 
uh production modes 
by CMS 
uh ggH VBF WH ZH and finally, the VH tronic. 
um the upper right shows uh a two d scan uh of ATLAS 
the uh WH production um 
versus uh ZH 
and then the lower left, 
uh the VBF versus ggf production. 
um 
the uh 
the agreement with the SM is model pretty good in most cases except for the uh VH hadronic uh 
as measured by CMS, uh where a a fa- 
upward fluctuation 
uh is observed. 
kay, so just to summarize uh higgs decays to 
all leptonic diboson final states uh provide valuable probes 
of its properties. 
uh the four lepton channel uh is used for precision measurements of 
the Higgs mass! 
uh is 
is sh- is shown 
here a both channels can be used for couplings measurements in the STXS framework. 
uh so, 
now we have final results 
in form four lepton channel uh 
with the full run two data set. 
um... 
tho of course, there's still room for more interpretations um 
again, there will be uh ta- sun talks discussing these a later 
and the WW channel is still uh results 
shown still only using the two thousand fifteen to sixteen data sets so we can definitely expect uh 
more results coming. 
uh thank you. 
thank you for this uh... nice overview. uh I see we have a uh... question, 
uh... Giovanni. 
okay it's 
Giovanni. 
uh so my question was on the mass. 
In the ZZ, you mentioned that you use a neural network to estimate the the event by event errors. Also using uh 
not just the leptons, but also per event data. 
I would 
I can see that happening for electrons, for example, maybe you're sensitive to pile up, I was just 
more curious 
what kind of event level information enters there. 
oh sorry, I mean, 
so 
it's just uh, 
for instance, the uh the constraint uh, 
error after the, the 
the error on the four lepton mass after the constraint or 
things 
things like uh 
thut- related to to the, 
I mean, what I meant was 
you have individual lepton information and also information from the uh 
the the the combination, 
but 
na- 
i don't think we're we're 
for using uh, 
variables like the the pileup at the moment, although we are currently 
exploring uh possibilities for improving this network uh for the uh 
for the final result that will be coming uh in the summer. 
okay, thank you. 
uh do I see we have another question Benedict, uh did you raise your hand? 
uh I don't think so. 
ah okay sorry no, that is uh 
it's just just a feature of the of the client, no problem. 
okay, then uh... I would propose we 
maybe i can ask a quick question. 
okay yes go ahead. 
uh if you go to slide eight 
um... 
is a so 
how it it wasn't clear for me how the background is treated 
in these uh probabilities, 
like is it including in, 
let's say background signal plus background? or is 
the background naturally gets pushed, 
uh as soon as we... 
let's say identify the signal that the 
the training is going on. 
uh my understanding is that that the the discriminants don't include the the 
the probability is only for Higgs production uh and not the backgrounds 
um 
okay, thanks 
now, let me share my screen. 
can you see my screen? 
yeah, it works. go ahead. 
okay, so yeah, uh today I'm going to be talking about recent ttH measurement with 
ATLAS experiment. 
and... 
oops, 
okay, 
we'll start with a brief motivation of 
why we're interested with ttH measurements. 
um... as we know all the Higgs property measurements so far consistent with standard model, 
and one of the infor measure uh infrom measurements are the couplings of the fermions, 
in particular the top Yukawa coupling, 
which is the goal of this ttH analysis, 
and we can directly measure it via ttH cross section measurements. 
Since the top Yukawa coupling is the largest in standard model as it's shown on the top right plot, 
it has a major impact on the theory, such as the 
impact on the um effective potential of the Higgs field and and which the vari- -riations on 
coupling can yield to the second minima 
that has an impact on the understanding of the metasta stability of the universe 
and and can be seen on the bottom to right plot, 
uh and also has an impact on self coupling of the Higgs which is still to be measured and 
and a major milestone of the... future LHC experiments. 
another interesting point 
CP nature of this coupling, 
uh where the standard model predicts CP even Higgs boson, 
but on the other hand uh... um the he 
a CP odd is not excluded yet. 
and on on bottom plot, you can see the total invariant mass distribution ending on the mixing angle, 
uh where difference can change the peak of mass uh distribution of ttH. 
and this talk is actually given by another um... another session in this um... in this conference. 
so, the ttH measurements at ATLAS experiment utilizes the broad range of fi final states originating from tt bar process and exploit Higgs decay mode. 
uh therefore the measurements are... uh categorized depending on the decay modes of Higgs boson, on bottom table 
i'm giving you um showing you those categories. 
a first category is the Higgs to bb channel. this channel has much high rate distrit, 
suffering from the enormous QCD background 
and the latest publication is with thirty-six inverse femtobarn. 
and the second group is called a ttH multilepton group, where it focuses on uh WZ boson and tau decays of Higgs boson. 
and the rate is reasonable but the background estimation is also challenging due to non prompt backgrounds, 
uh the latest publications is with eighteen inverse femtobarn. 
uh... the last category is ZZ and gamma gamma decays where the decay rates are quite small, 
with respect others. 
however, they have a clean uh signal without 
backgrounds. 
and the latest publication for both of them with full run two data set. 
and the final observed, 
and the finally observation of the ttH measurement announced by A AS in thousand eighteen 
where only the gamma gamma channels was using eighty much femtobarn and the rate 
the other were using uh thirty six inverse femtobarn. 
In next slide I'm starting with Higgs to bb channel and I shouldn't go so much in details since it was uh see 
it was presented many times in this conference 
and and this channel we are is curr currently working on the updating the che uh the results with the full run two data. 
uh... just to give some brief information this channel is most common on other 
channel categories, but it has a challenging final step as I said, 
and uh for this situation, 
for, to handle the situation the various control regions are defined to constrain those backgrounds, 
and analysis regions are split in two with one lepton and dilepton, 
and also 
a a boosted one lepton channel is 
um exploited. 
the signal and control regions are defined depending on the number of jets and the b-tagging working point. 
an example sketch us is given uh on the right bottom 
and the y x and y axes represent a combination of different working points 
for the b-jets 
and the tightest will be the highest purity in ttH and as it loosen, 
uh the control regions are defined. 
and the main challenge is the modelling of the tt bar jet backgrounds. 
uh since it's infe it's infer indirectly with the tt Higgs to bb final state as it can be seen from the given Feynman diagram here. 
uh and the control regions are depending on the flavor of the jets. 
and furthermore, numbers of the uncertains are implemented 
to cover the modeling differences between different schemes and the generators. 
and also the analysis make use soph sophisticated multivariate techniques to extract the signal region 
in which I'm going to talk about in the next slide. 
so, two steps were emplo uh employed to discriminate better the signal from background. 
uh what's called intermediate techniques are uh focusing on the reconstruction of the tt Higgs system, 
such as the... reconstruct uh... extraction boosted decision tree to u... to get the best Higgs and top candidates in event. 
and the the likelihood discriminant considers the kinematic 
the possible jet particle assignments and calculates the discriminant for each event again 
and the matrix element method also provides uh discrimination built from first principles. 
on the bottom plot, 
left plot, the proper for discrimination on the 
reconstruction of the Higgs boson mass is given. 
and finally, 
those outputs from uh methods are combined with an additional information in the second stage 
in which is called the 
classification BDT, 
which will will be used to extract the signal strength 
and... on the bottom right plot one of the... signal region in this channel is shown, 
where the classification BDT is used and obviously, discrimination is quite successful. 
coming to the fit setup uh tt Higgs bb uses the profile likelihood fit to extract uh... mu ttH, 
uh in ten control region and nine signal regions. 
the classification BDT 
is used for signal region, and for the control regions usually a single bin or kinematic variable a 
such as some of the PT of the let objects. 
um... the major backgrounds are tt plus jets, 
uh are, 
a are free floating in the fit to control better... uh those backgrounds. 
and the summary of the distributions are given on the right side of the slides 
and showing the comparison of expected and um observed yields and overall very good agreement with data is observed, 
and the results for each channel is given on the... table bottom left. 
na... the significance is one point four sigma observed with one point six si sigma expected. 
and the major backgrounds are arising from um tt plus jets modeling and the 
in the in from the Monte Carlo statistics. 
and um o obviously the analysis is dominated by uh 
stematic uncertainties. 
uh so, I now I move to the second analysis categories called ttH multilepton. 
and this analysis is focusing on the Higgs to WW, ZZ and tau tau decay modes, together with tt bar system, 
requiring um at least one lepton. 
uh the baseline selection of these uh analysis channels are done depending on the charge and the flavor of the leptons. 
there are six channels are used, three of them with and without hadronic 
a taus in the final states, 
as shown on the table right, 
um... the most sensitive channels are uh... two leptons, same sign, zero tau and 
the three leptons zero tau, 
are also further split into control regions to constrain the different uh... 
different sources of the backgrounds. 
Uh the main backgrounds are standard model processes such as the tW, ttZ, diboson and also the non prompt backgrounds, mainly coming from ttb ar process, 
uh... such as leptons from ra uh... arising from semileptonic b decays or or the conversions or tree electrons where uh one of the electron uh has charged misassigned. 
And to further the the to further reduce those 
background contributions, there is special uh object selections are used on top of the baseline selections. 
At the BDT for instance, uh I BDT isolation uh is employed, 
to reduce the leptons from heavy decay flavors, flavor decays, and a charge misid BDT 
also provided by performance group is used, and and the variables to reject the material and gamma star conversions are also benefited. 
Just to be a bit more concrete, uh in this slide, I'm showing you the region definition on most sensitive channels in ttH multilepton. 
And as well as uh 
I will give some details about non prompt background estimation. 
Uh... the regions are further divided 
into high and low NJet regions. In high NJets regions uh... the multi dimensional BDT space is exploit for signal and control region, 
and also fu further split on depending 
on the charge and the flavour of the leptons to to constrain different source of backgrounds again, 
and it contains again signal regions in high P T and control regions. 
And the low NJet regions are more dedicated to control the non prompt backgrounds 
and also the ttW standard model process. 
And there are some kinematic variables such as uh HT lepton, N b-jet distribution and also events yield is used. 
And on the right plot I'm showing you one of these regions in this category. 
Um... there's sum of the pT of the leptons, 
here the orange distrub 
uh the orange contribution is non prompt muons 
and is populated in the first two bins. 
It gives a good um control of this background. 
And the estimation of a light background, light lepton background, based on the Monte Carlo shapes. 
And the normalizations are obtained from simultaneous fit to signal strength. 
And hum here I'm giving you these processes. 
Uh Heavy flavor semileptonic decay, where an isolated lepton can be reconstructed within the heavy flavor, 
and uh 
sorry, 
and dedicated normalization factors for muons and electrons are defined. 
The second is the electron from material conversion, 
where the gamma interact with detector material and resulting in one is isolated lepton 
and the last one is electron from internal conversions, 
where the virtual... um gamma star decays into two leptons, again, one being isolated. 
And it can occur in at a parton showel, 
uh shower or the matrix element depending on generator. 
Um on slide number nine I want to give a more details about ttW measurements within the ttH multilepton channel. 
Uh... the standard model's 
ttW process is free floated in the simultaneous fit 
uh due to the high contamination in both control and signal regions. 
Um three decorrelated normalization 
factors are assigned: two lepton same sign uh low NJet, high NJet, and three lepton. 
And the reason why we divide the normalization factors is that the different phase space yields the different values 
and on the right plot the inclusive um num ehm N jet distribution for 
um for 
two leptons same sign is shown. 
Um... uh here the dashed lines on the ratio plot 
in... indicates the pre-fit ratio. 
And it's clear that the first two bins needs a more ttW than the rest to improve the, the data Monte Carlo agreement. 
Um... however these results uh give us a more a ttW than the standard 
expected. These values are given on the table here, 
and on those numbers are also including a missing higher order corrections 
to account for NLO uh ttW plus jets 
due to the opening up in the quark uh... gluon quark initiated process 
and also the electroweak, 
uh corrections, 
uh where the NLO tree term is dominating due to the tt 
tW scattering through Higgs boson 
and also were not include to the yellow report four, 
and as well as the nominal sample of us 
and impacts on them can be non negligible. 
And finally, this uh the mismodelings are seen 
o observed in a two b plus plus region. 
And this difference is added in the fit model as a shape uncertainty for the ttW phase space. 
And the motivation behind this is um purely experimental. 
Uh but actually the charges meth is is known for a minimum for a ttW process. 
And also, um there's very interesting talk in this 
um... 
this section about ttW modelling. 
Um... on the last slide in this channel uh... is for the fit set up. 
Uh as usual profile likelihood used for 
uh seventeen control regions and eight signal region as shown in the bottom plot 
and results per channel is given on bottom right plot. 
And the overall significance is one point eight sigma observed with three point one sigma expect 
and the majors schematics are jess 
uh and ttll modelling and ttW modeling and overall 
an good data Monte Carlo agreement, 
is observed. 
The next search that I'm going to cover today is to Higgs tt to gamma gamma. 
This channel is using already full run two data. 
And... regions are divided into hadronic where uh there is one lepton veto. 
There is lepton veto, and the leptonic where there one or more leptons in the final state, 
and of course with two well isolated photons. 
Um the background estimation is taken from sidebands in data where the photon requirement is uh reversed. 
and also 
they make use of dedicated control samples to define the function to fit it. 
And after certain cuts on BDT to reject the highest possible background contamination, 
um... the be the regions are further divided depending on the purity of the signal. 
And signal extraction is performed in invariant mass of diphoton distribution by using double sided 
Crystal Ball function. And here on top 
right I'm showing you all the regions included in the fit and bottom post shows 
you the fit to the invariant mass of um diphoton system in all categories, uh where 
the events are weighted depending on the purity of the category. 
The significance was found 
to be, okay. 
The significance is found to be 
four point nine sigmas observed, 
uh which means this channel has already almost uh reached the observation uh... alone. 
And this um... 
result as we expect is stat limited. The last channel I'm going to cover today is 
Um the last channel I'm going to cover today is the ttH production where the Higgs decays to ZZ and subsequently to four l. 
And in this relevant paper in fact, the cross sections are measured for main production modes. 
In in in several exclusive regions of the Higgs boson production phase space, 
but today I will just talk about only the ttH production mode. In the analysis used, also make 
use a from full run two statistics. 
Uh... and they focus on the Higgs mass window between hundred fifteen and hundred thirty for the signal regions, is quite low. 
And the um the background estimations are done from the dedicated sidebands and the analysis regions are classified depending on the tt bar decays. 
Uh the event yield is used uh for the ttH, uh for the signal 
extraction in in ttH lepton enriched region, and for the ttH hadronic region. 
A... sophisticated neural network 
algorithms are exploited. 
which are trained against the back uh main backgrounds 
and as a result, 
and two indepedendent outputs are used to extract in this region, 
and the distributions are given on the bottom plot. 
then the extracted signal is one point 
seven with big statistics uncertainty as expected, but um three 
candidates in total are observed in this channel which is a good success uh with such a smaller channel. 
and finally, I'm come back to a combination of ttH measurements. 
um there is no combination is perform yet for by exploiting uh the 
latest results that I've shown today. 
um however, the observation of ttH measurement was already performed 
uh using a very la 
using a partially run two data. 
and here on the left plot I'm showing you data and theory comparison of results with the 
first point from run one and the second point from partially run two data 
and oh on right plot uh there is of all channel contribute to that observation which um... 
is shown 
and and uh fo five point eight sigma is uh is observed. 
and also the the co the combined 
with this result with full uh with run one 
uh and 
and have the six point three sigma was observe 
uh it take six point sigma a observed 
okay so then in conclusion, uh I showed today the latest studies related to tt Higgs measurements. 
uh ATLAS has 
established observation of ttH production by com uh 
uh combining various Higgs decay channels and results are all compatible standard model. 
and some individual channels updated their results with more data. 
um observation, 
for example, observation, uh... 
almost observation with ttH production in gamma gamma channel. 
and also, uh the tree events are observed with uh e 
uh ttH uh four l channel. 
and 
for, and for the other channels there's uh the challenging background is there always 
and requires better understanding of the background modellings, 
such as um ttW. 
tt uh bb. 
and... currently the improvements are expected with full run two data. 
and also the full run two data will uh allow us a new opportunities 
uh... 
studie including um differential 
a measurements and also the property measures. 
thank you. 
thank you very much. 
uh... any questions? 
yeah, i see marco has a question. go ahead. 
yeah, thank you for this very nice talk. so, I think in the context of this session 
in particular your slide nine is uh, is very interesting. 
so, maybe could could you take the chance to add some details on the justification for this say decorrelation, 
whether you have done uh some studies uh also on the say generator level phase space, cause, 
i mean, naively one could uh 
uh... wonder whether this full decorrelation of these three reco level say phase spaces 
a isn't uh... too... conservative from from our point of view, 
and then a second part, I mean, to to the same question could be, um... whether you checked 
uh... weather you have, uh... for instance uh, ttW events that end up confusing with the ttH ones 
even at higher jet multiplicities, I mean here the last bin you show is 
the inclusive six jet bin, well, 
i uh i would suspect that even higher jet multiplicities you uh... 
could play an important role uh as a background for ttH in say high 
uh... 
S over B regions. 
thank you. 
okay, uh let me try to uh... get her all. um for the second part I will say for the ttH and ttW 
um... uh we don't expect to have 
such events because um i mean in the end, we have the correlation matrix in after the fit 
that we have uh... we have such not that uh higher ttW and ttH 
um... a correlations in in both uh normalization factors. 
um... and for the first 
point is i'm not sure i really understood your 
question is, I think it was about um... 
is it too conservative to have decorrelated normalization factors, i guess? 
so that the question is for instance, why do you uh decorrelate three lepton 
uh... 
from two lepton low jet that in principle, 
i i would 
suspect they're populated by the same say kind of ttW events in a generator level phase space apart 
uh... from from the decay, right. 
okay. um... so, uh there was a dedic a, we had dedicated study for that, in fact, 
um... uh... 
while, ehm... 
uh for for example, for the 
control region only uh fit into a three lepton, 
and we have also the same um... uh the normalization 
factor of ttW and the similar one, and where we have only one 
normalization factor, uh this um t tree t l region is um is really a lowering down 
uh in the... i mean its its normalisation factor is going really low and then in fa in fact 
the ttH, uh measurements. 
and so we found that this decorrelation of three of them is is 
basically uh... is more reasonable. 
okay, uh are there any other questions? 
you can raise your hands if yes. 
okay, i don't see anything else. 
okay, thank you very much uh Merve and we move 
okay, I guess we should start. so good afternoon, morning or evening according to your timezone 
and welcome to the upgrade session. 
we will have four presentations by each of the LHC experiments. 
each presentation with twenty-five minutes which is twenty minutes plus five minutes for question. 
I'd likely to ask the speakers to be correct with their timee. 
so the first will be from ALICE. so yeah, Piotr, Piotr. 
you can start anytime. 
okay, good afternoon. can you hear me? 
yes, we can. 
so I share my slides, and I would like to 
thank uh for the organizers for the opportunity of giving this talk. 
of showink you the statous of the Alice uh upgrades for run three, 
run four and also uh beyond. uh Alice, as it was already introduced today on the highlight talk by Andrea, 
is a dedicated heavy-ion experiment at CERN LHC. 
it consists of several uh... detectors. the central Barrel detectors: the ITS, TPC 
surrounding the interaction point and followed by the TRD, TOF, detectors um, all installed within the magnetic field of zero point five tesla. 
and the muon spectrometer in forward rapidities, and complimentary forward detectors for triggering, centrality estimates. 
it showt uh... great tracking and PID capabilities in large kinematic range um. 
it was successfully operated in Run one and Run two, 
when we took a lot of em data 
uh... from the collisions from the systems provided by the machine, and man of the vantastic results will be uh... discussed and presented during this uh conference. 
we obviously continue, uh we plan to continue taking ehm, data in Run three and Run four. This is the pre-COVID timeline of LHC. 
and... as I already said, in Run three and Run four, ALICE will continue operation. 
we have a rich prese physics program ahead of us uh stemming from 
uh heavy-flavor mesons and baryons, charmonium states, dileptons 
and low-mass vector mesons and high-precision measurements of light and hyper... -nuclei. 
all these observables to, uh i will be use to characterize quark-gluon plasma in in much more details. 
uh and as you can see from this list of observables, 
uh thus 
we cannot run with a dedicated trigger. 
we need a minimum-bias readout at highest possible rates, and this will be, 
um... this will be accomplished with the major upgrades. 
uh we are uh ALICE is now undergoing. 
the ALICE strategy for Run three and four is to increase minimum-bias sample by a factor of up to hundred with respect to Run two, 
collecting integrated luminosity of thirteen inverse nano barns, 
and write all led-led interactions as fifty kilohertz. 
we will run without uh dedicated trigger and man of the detectors we want in the continuous readout mode. 
we will improve tracking efficiency and resolution especially at low pT and we need to preserve particle identification by 
consolidating and speeding up main ALICE PID detectors. 
the the Run three upgrades were uh... discussed and tse described in these technical design reports. 
and I will discuss today, um... the following: the new Inner Tracking System based on the new MAPS technology. 
uh... also based on MAPS the new Muon Forward Tracker. 
also our TPC is undergoing a major upgrade. the old readout chambers are upgraded with the GEM, uh technology. 
we will also have new fast integration trigger detectors. 
and the data from all these new and upgraded detectors will be, ehm... will be read out, recorded and analyzed by the, 
new integrated online-offline system, O-square. 
in addition, we are also upgrading our readout of the all all ther, remaining detectors, including also central trigger, processor. 
so let's start with the upgrades ALICE TPC: 
uh is the main PID detector of uh of ALICE, 
almost ninety cubic meter, tank filled with gas, Neon, or argon based, 
gas mixture it has, 
five meter diameter and uh length of five meters. 
and 
central electrode 
in the middle it defines two drift volumes two and a half, meter long each. 
uh the maximum drift time of around hundred microseconds 
for electrons which are then drifting towards the end plates on both sides and are read out by the multi-wire proportional, 
uh... multi-wire proportional chambers in one Run one and Run two. 
uh... the chambers are divided into sectors and fur... and further into inner and readout and outer readout chambers, of IROC and OROC. 
uh... as I said, MWPCs were used in Run one and Run two. 
uh... we have altogether seventy-two readout chambers with more an half a million of 
uh... pads for a signal readout. 
and the multi-wire proportional chamber technology obviously was also using wire gating grid, to minimize number of back-drifting ions to the drift volume, and thus um... 
distorting the drift field. 
uh this, however, this gating grid readout implies the rate limitation for the readout uh to only 
few kilohertz and, obviously, to operate the TPC at higher rates, fifty kilohertz or more, 
we uh we need to abandon this this technology, and uh and uh and run TPC continuously. 
and this will be realized using GEMs, gas electron multipliers. 
um... these are the thin polyimide foil covered with uh, with copper on both sides and in the photo, lithography uh process the 
microscopic holes are etched. you apply high voltage across the foil and you create high electric field inside these holes. 
and this is where the amplification takes place. 
and the em... and ions also which are created in this amplification 
uh... are drifting back, 
and they are, most of them, uh they are collected on the top side of the GEM. so, this 
intrinsic ion backflow suppression of GEM foils allows to abandon the gating grid option and run TPC continuously. the TPC upgrade requirements were, uh given in two thousand twelve 
in Letter of Intent. uh we uh will run these em a detectors at the nominal gain of two thousand in 
Ne-CO two-nitrogen. uh gas mixture, keeping ion backflow below one percent, which means only twenty ions will leave, the amplification stage per incoming electron. 
the energy resolution of the system needs to be kept at the uh good 
level below twelve percent uh measured for iron peak, 
and of course we need to assure the stable operation under LHC Run three conditions. 
and in the intensive R and D uh process, we found the solution uh for our uh new readout chambers, the quadruple GEM stacks 
uh... employing um Standard and Large-Pitch GEM foils in the in uh in this in this order 
Standard, Large-Pitch, Large-Pitch, Standard. and they are running, they will be operated with 
highly optimized high-voltage configuration. on the hand right hand side you 
can see a plot sigma (energy resolution) as a function of ion backflow. 
each data point corresponds to different high voltage settings. and you can see that 
several high voltage settings uh fulfill our requirements. later, also, our studies showed 
that we can relax a little bit requirements. 
sigma up to fourteen percent and ion backflow up up to two, so we have a lot of room for adjustment. 
uh the TPC readout chambers are 
already built. uh IROCs consist of a single uh quadruple GEM stack and OROCs uh have 
three quadruple GEM stacks. and in parallel to the readout chamber upgrade we also 
developed new, uh front-end ASIC, SAMPA. this was a common development for both TPC and 
MUON chambers. 
this is hundred and thirty nanometer, CMOS uh chip 
uh providing thirty two input channels and can be read out continuously or in a trigger mode. 
it has excellent noise figure of six hundred seventy uh electrons and the 
front-on cards for the TPC will host five of such chips. 
and altogether we'll have almost thirty three hundred front-on cards in the TPC. 
uh which will continuously digitize signals at five megahertz, 
and so the data output will be around three point three terabyte per second. 
this amount of data needs to be, of course reduced and I will discuss that later 
um... in the O square part of my talk. 
uh, the TPC upgrade is ongoing. essentially, TPC was extracted and 
upgraded in the cleanroom already last year. uh all chambers are installed, 
as you can see here, in the middle bottom picture you can see the reflection of the GEM uh chambers 
in the central electrode uh and also a front-end electronics is uh installed. and since 
a several months we take, the um... pre-commissioning data, 
uh we are pre-commissioning our detector, uh... meaning that we test the two sectors at a time, measuring pulser noise, 
a taking laser and cosmic runs and irritating our chambers with with X-ray sources. 
here you can see some examples of the laser tracks detected with GEMs. 
our excellent noise figure of one ADC, so as designed. and also some nice uh examples of the cosmic, uh cosmic tracks. 
we start reinstallation in July twenty twenty, 
uh... after, uh after this uh... delay caused by the current health situation. I will discuss the timeline later. 
now, coming to the new ALICE detectors for Run three. 
this is the Inner Tracking System Muon Forward Tracker and FIT detectors. 
Inner Tracking System and Muon Forward Tracker are detectors based on the novel 
monolithic active uh active pixel sensor uh technology. these uh, this chips are produced in a TowerJazz hundred eighty nanometer technology, where the circuits are are produced on um... on epitaxial layer 
highly resistive epitaxial layer uh on the uh highly um highvy-doped p-substrates. 
the epitaxial layer, uh... thickness is twenty-five ma micrometers which means that the minimum ionizing particle 
will create around thirteen hundred uh electron-hole pairs all electrons will be um... drifting towards the N-well diodes the sensing diodes 
which are two by two micrometer square large, 
so hundred times less than pixel pitch and this gives very small input capacitance. 
and, thus uh... large relatively large input signal of forty millivolts. 
uh taking into account the uh noise figure of five electrons we'll end up with very nice signal-to-background uh ratio 
and this, all that um... I think, justifies that MAPS are the great technology 
to be used as a tracker, in central tracker of such detectors 
and it will be used for the first time on such a scale in the LHC, experiment. 
so MAPS are used to uh develop were used to develop ALPIDE chip 
ALICE Pixel Detector. this is, again, common development for ITS and MFT, as I already said. 
it hosts around hundred thirty thousand pixels per square centimeter and can deal with pac particle rates up to hundred megahertz per square centimeter. 
uh in comparison to the old ITS, you can see on the bottom left side, 
uh the old ITS system, which is already uh in ALICE exhibition, 
the new ITS two will have several advantages: 
it will improve, uh vertex and tracking precision, it will be installed closer to the interaction poit, 
uh point, it will have larger pseudorapidity coverage than the old ITS 
and, the most important, it will be also thinner can so the material budget will be more than three times, uh less for the innermost layers than the old ITS, uh... system. 
uh with smaller pixel size and higher granularity, our spatial resolution figure will be around five micrometers. 
and the readouts rate, capabilities uh will reach around hundred kilohertz in the data no uh more than one megahertz in Proton-uh Proton collisions. 
this is the layout: um the ITS two will consist of seven layers three inner, two middle and two outer layers. 
and altogether it um it consist of hundred ninety-two so-called staves. 
um... the also was a big engineering efforts to produce ultra-weight support for all these chips 
which would ehm ehm not only support the chips but also provide uh cooling. 
what's the status? again the detector is uh... um produced, uh detector integration is finished. 
um... it's ongoing on-surface commissioning, where we equilibrate thresholds, taking cosmic data and check its stability 
It's, I think, worth to emphasize that we have extremely low noise figure and by masking only few pads we get the fake-hit rate 
of below uh... ten to minus ten. 
um... now, we are testing the insertion of the ITS into the TPC. 
after the TPC is pre-commissioned um... this test will will follow, and we are uh... preparing for the installation of the ITS two beginning of next, year. 
now, uh... building new ITS and having upgraded TPC we, obviously, uh foresee improvement in their performance. 
so this uh improvement in the central barrel region means the uh the ITS tracking efficiency will will increase, especially for the low pT, 
uh also we'll see improved tracking resolution and pointing resolution. 
and if you consider the momentum resolution with the new TPC readout chambers we see, as required, 
the momentum resolution will not uh will be preserved with the new uh TPC and ITS uh tracks. 
this of course has an influence on the physics performance. 
this is only one uh... one example of low-mass uh di-electron spectra. 
you can see with the hundred times more statistics, we will obviously improve our uncertainty figure. 
and more about our uh future uh future uh physics outcome with the new detectors, you will in other presentations in this conference and I will refer to that later. 
now, coming to the forward rapidity region: MFT- Muon Forward Tracker and FIT. 
um... the main objective of the Muon Forward Tracker is to uh provide extra vertexing capabilities of our Muon Arm. 
uh our Muon System consist of tracking chambers, which are installed several meters away from the interaction point. 
also, they're installed behind this massive absorber. 
so, obviously, the pointing resolution, vertexing resolution cannot, uh be better than a... millimeter on the milli. 
uh others quantitude. 
and with this extra five layers of the muon tracker, 
close to the interaction point, uh we will improve this figure, obviously. 
uh... the MFT is based on alpite uh ALPIDE chips. 
uh... we have five stations uh um built out of ten half-disks. 
and the set again, assembly and integration of uh of the detector, is completed. 
again for the uh future performance, we uh we hope to get to the sub-millimeter lebel for pointing accuracy, for uh... for the ver vertex reconstruction 
uh this will, uh obviously, improve our reconstruction of the, displaced J/psi uh vertices from the uh... B hadron decays. 
uh we'll also uh we'll improve the J/psi background, um... and we also hope to to to improve visibility of the psi two S, uh particles even in central led-led collisions. 
last but not least, the low-mass region of the uh... di-muon spectrum will also be uh improved. 
you can see here the comparison before and after adding MFT these are, of course, simulations but we soons will be able to see eta mesons, uh very nicely also here, uh in the di-muonuh... spectra. 
now, coming to the, last new detector in this in this list: 
the FIT- Fast Interaction Trigger it consists of several detectors. 
um... the, the new FIT will provide information to the Central, uh Central Trigger of ALICE 
uh... used for the luminosity leveling it will be used for luminosity leveling, um identification of the diffractive processes and also providing the T zero for uh for uh... Time-of-Flight PID, uh... processes. 
uh it consists of large-acceptance um... a scintillation detector, on one side of the interaction point. 
then we have Cherenkov uh detectors on both sides of the interaction point and then these forward diffractive detectors, uh... placed seventeen to nineteen meters from the interaction point. 
it will it will improve our centrality resolution measurements and uh... and uh... centrality resolution. 
and... and also provide hm... high-resolution T zero for our, uh... time-of-flight uh PID. 
and more on these detectors you can find in the posters presented uh presented on this conference. 
now, coming back to the reinstallation as you can see behind my beck and also on this picture: uh ALICE is ready uh to host new and upgraded detectors. 
um... the the re-installation sequence, after this uh COVID uh delay, will start uh around July, uh twenty twenty, so uh in uh two months from now, or even less, 
uh with re-installation of the TPC in the ALICE Cavern, followed by the installation of the cage and central beampipe, Miniframe, 
and then, the new detectors FIT, MFT and ITS will be installed. we're supposed to be ready um... with the installation uh... in May twenty twenty-one 
and this is when the global commissioning st will start. we need around sixteen weeks of global commissioning and, um... we'll be ready for pp collisions end of August twenty twenty-one. 
Piotr five minute left. 
thank you. uh concerning the online offline data processing as I said the new detectors will provide a lot of data. 
this is just an example. this is a sub-timeframe of two millisecond uh two millisecond long. 
these are the Monte Carlo events overlaid on cluster level, using realistic bunch crossing structure. 
uh... this, this is this is a snapshot from what TPC will uh and other detectors will deliver, and all that needs to be processed with our O square system. 
so around three point three uh or three point five terabytes per second of data will uh will in continuous mode 
on continuous mode uh will arrive to the first level processor. 
uh and then the first kind of reduction uh data reduction and compression will take place. 
zero suppression, for example, and then the sub-timeframes of the length of ten to twenty milliseconds will be sent to the event processing nodes. 
uh here, the full uh full online data processing will be done on GPUs. 
um... we we estimate that we need around two thousand or less GPUs. 
and this will be nice uh efficiency increase with respect to the CPUs as a single GPU can replace more than fifty CPUs, in some configurations. 
so this is jop ongoing we are preparing for that. you can see the CR zero, the Control Room zero, is ready. 
and the data will be further reduced in this stage 
and we'll save to disk, for further physics and data processing, around hundred gigabytes per second. 
now, coming to Run four. as I said, we are preparing also upgrades for uh... Run four, after LS three. 
uh... one of the upgrades proposed recently is the Inner Barrel of the ITS this will be called ITS three. 
fully cylindrical, almost massless inner barrel for the inner tracking system. 
it will also co uh consist of the new beam pipe uh with smaller inner radius. 
and... the plan is to build three cylindrical wafer size layers based on curved, ultra-thin sensors with almost no material budget. 
you can see the comparison of ITS two, so the new one, and ITS three, so the future new one. 
um... material budget will have only uh material budget of of silicon to to consider. 
and the first tests of the ALPIDE sensor being curved to the radius of two centimeters are ongoing. 
uh the project is accepted by LHCC and we are run uh we are working towards the TDR in twenty twenty uh two. 
the expected performance: again we expect further uh improvements: 
resolution improvement by factor of two and efficiency improvement by a factor of two, 
especially the low uh pT. it will obviously have impact on physics and more on that, 
um... I I would like to refer to the to the talk by Fabrizio on physics perspectives for ALICE one and four. 
and he will also mention another upgrade, which is now, currently, uh under discussion. 
it was accepted by, uh... by our collaboration and it will be submitted to LHCC. 
the forward calorimeter- FoCal. 
uh... it will have unique capabilities to measure direct photons in pp and p-led collisions. 
uh it will allow us to study the nucleon structure at small uh Bjorken x scale and at low momentum transfer. 
it will consist of to two um... two calorimeters and the main cha- the 
hadronic and electromagnetic one, and the main challenge will be to separate gammas 
and pi zeros, pi zero high energies. 
so, for this electromagne- 
calorimeters, 
uh we'll use highly-gra- high-granularity, Si-W calorimeter with MAPS layers, again. 
um... and as I said, the the project is uh... accepted by by the collaboration, and we can 
expect TDR uh end of twenty twenty one. 
now, coming to the future, like ten years from now so 
after uh... long shutdown four uh... there's also some uh planning so recently we submitted 
expression of Interest for a all-silicon detector to be installed during LS four. 
this was an input the European Strategy Update and you can find more details under this link. 
um... this all-silicon detector would increase rate capabilities 
by a factor next factor fifty with respect to ALICE Run four. 
this will be detector not based onTPC anymore. uh it will be based on uh silicon detectors. 
it would consist of a tracker with ten tracking barrels um barrel layers based of MAPS, 
with great resolution po- um uh position resolution and almost uh no material uh... budget for inner tracking layers. 
uh... the TOF PID would be given by also a silicon detectors 
and then, electron-gamma identification would be done by a high-granularity shower pixel detector. 
physics uh... physics um 
i mean physics um, goals 
uh... stem from the electromagnetic probe at ultra-low pT down to several tens of megaelectron volts, per c. 
uh... to precision physics in charm and beauty sector. and again, uh to to to learn more 
about the future and uh and possibilities of building such a detector please, 
um... please follow the talk which was uh... was shown today. 
uh... but you can still see the slines under the link given here. 
so, this brings me to the summary and outlook. 
ALICE is undergoing a major upgrade for the operation in Run three. 
and the major detector upgrades in- ehm involves TPC, ITS, uh Muon Forward Tracker and FIT detectors. 
also our readout system will be upgraded and we're also bre- uh we're also working on the new online O square uh online-offline um... O square system, for the data uh... analysis. 
installation of the upgraded and new detectors will start in summer twenty twenty and ALICE will be ready for pp collisions end of august twenty twenty one. 
we also propose new upgrades in view of run four 
and this is uh inner barrel of the ITS and the forward calorimeter. and we are also 
preparing a new generation of um... of a heavy-ion detector all silicon experiment beyond LS four. 
and with this, I would like to thank you for your attention. 
okay, thank you very much Piotr for giving so much information and staying in time. 
I'm sure that must be question remember people I remind people to raise their hands 
and then we will unmute you. 
so the first question is from Ilya Gorbunov, please state your name and institute. 
hello, uh... I am Ilya Gorbunov from JINR, 
Dubna 
uh... I, I have a question on slide number twenty nine. 
uh... so here you say that uh... 
the GPU usage can cree- uh can replace up to fifty C- uh CPU models and what about the software? 
Did you revisit all the software used by ATLAS to... be able to run on the GPUs? 
what's the situation with the offline software? 
What's the situation with the offline software? thank you. 
so concerning, first of all, concerning the number of fifty. this of course, depends on the on the... 
on the unit you you will choose and then, as I said, as it written here, the the final choice will be done soon. 
uh... concerning the offline uh... software, I mean, I would I would, I would prefer to to um... to uh... adve- advertise two other talks, where mu- much more detail on that will be will be given. 
um... and I think the especially the uh... um the um talk, the second talk on 
the GPU uh analysis will, kind of, um consolidate uh approach of all uh LHC experiments. 
I don't see other questions. I have a question myself actually on slide thirty five. 
well, you stated that the material thickness would be less than zero point zero five percent 
of the radiation length per inner tracking layer. 
that looks exceedingly good. 
is this wishful thinking or is it something reality? what what is the thickness of the layers? 
so, the current thickness of of of ALPIDE chip is around fifty micrometers. 
uh... 
as you can see from the from from this simulations, 
this this consists of several layers of of different uh... materials. so, here you 
can see already, ba- based on on our predictions for ITS three, 
uh removing all these services, um... 
uh all these services uh all but also including other materials like glue uh... and aluminium, Kapton from from the from the flex- uh services, 
uh you can go down to the really to the bare a silicon material. 
and this is this is this is where our material budget um improvement is coming from. 
it's really what I see there: twenty to forty micron thickness. 
yes yes, so five fifty is currently 
and then with further uh minimizing of this thickness, we can go to this twenty forty and this very small material budget. 
okay, thank you. 
there's still time for question too. 
if there are no questions then, well, we thank virtually again Piotr. 
there'd be the clapping of hands. that's also virtual. 
and then we move to the ne-. 
okay, so I will start now. uh so I'm going um to present today about what we have learned uh 
on the Higgs sector in terms of production, decay properties and differential distribution at LHC. so first of all a small reminder that the Higgs sector 
was introduced in the Standard Model, thanks to several seminal papers, which 
here you have a small selections, and that the Higgs boson was discovered 
in thousand twelve by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at LHC. so if um now we 
look uh into the Standard Model Lagrangian, the first thing that uh strikes out is that 
the Higgs boson is the only fundamental particle of spin zero the standard model 
that it appears in several of its terms. so for example, we have here the terms 
that describe the interaction of the Higgs boson to the uh fermions, which uh in 
particular, the term which is proportional to the fermion mass, and also we have the 
kinematic term that also include the so called, let's say, standard interaction 
with the gauge bosons of the Higgs, and as well as the finally the uh Higgs po- uh potential, which is 
responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking, and makes the Higgs uh field uh 
special. so then, uh then uh what I'm going to talk today about is mainly about the 
precision measurements that you see here, the couplings, differential cross section, 
the interpretation, the mass, and the spin CP, as well as the Yukawa interaction with the 
third generation fermions. and um the other topics in orange will be covered by 
Giovanni talk later in in this session. I also woul- like to point out the specific talks 
in the parallel session that where you can see these topics expanded in in more details if you're interested. 
so let's start now with the uh what um the are the predictions in 
terms of a production and decay for the Higgs bosons so when we look at thirteen TeV, 
which is uh the en- -gy in the center of mass of uh the LHC during Run two. we see that 
the gluon-gluon fusion production is by far the dominant production mode of the Higgs boson followed by the vector fusions and the associated production uh with 
the a vector bosons. and finally, uh the uh tt- uh ttH uh associated prod- uh production. we also 
have other production modes not least here like bbH and single-top Higgs productions 
that um are also in in this plot. uh also I would like to point out that the first two 
the gluon-gluon fusion and the VBF production were observed already during Run one of the LHC 
while the associated production with vector boson and ttH were observed 
on the uh during Run 2. so, the in terms of uh uh decay modes, the bb bar is um the 
dominant decay of the Higgs bosons but not the easiest one at the LHC. and, uh in 
fact the... uh the case of la- in in two photons and two Z and even in particular the case 
where the Z the decays to four leptons were in fact among the first to be discovered, 
despite their low branching ratio, thanks to the uh good signal to background ratio 
together with the WW, which uh is also the other bosonic channels that contributed to 
the first observation of the Higgs boson. at the end of Run two, uh Run one, uh the Higgs to tau tau was 
also observed, and the, the Higgs to bb bar was later observed during uh the Run two uh of LHC. 
now the... um... the just a small um slide on the ATLAS and CMS detector that in particular 
during uh the run one and run two had very good performance and uh the LHC as well in 
fact, uh already past their design uh performance in terms of peak luminosity, 
as you can see, that uh LHC already doubled the um nominal peak luminosity of ten to 
the thirty four. and also in terms of number of interaction per bunch crossing. the average 
in Run two was thirty four compared to the design value of about twenty three. and that they 
delivered um... luminosity by the um... accelerator was around the thirty inverse femtobarn during Run one 
one hundred sixty inverse femtobarn during Run two. so, quite good performance, I would say. 
um... now discussing the... uh the measurement of the Higgs bosons, I would like to start with 
the cross sections one uh... if we believe the Standard Model, uh there should be about 
fifty six thousand Higgs bosons produced per inverse femptobarn for each of the 
experiments in each of the interaction point of the LHC and the the ATLAS CMS 
experiments can reconstruct about two hundred per inverse femtobarn. uh so the this 
allows to make uh, especially during Run two, precise measurement of the Higgs boson's cross section. and you have here an example of this measurement by ATLAS, where uh this is uh 
done by a production mode and by in in decay channel and you see that um several 
these uh measurements are still limited by statistic which is highlighted by this yellow band uh and the table is a is also quite complete. and a way also to um... make uh the cross section to um to present the cross section measurement was already established uh 
by the... hm during Run one by the first uh a measurements. is are the so called the 
signal strength which is basically the cross section divide the Standard Model prediction 
and you have in this uh CMS uh uh summary a good example of how the 
experiment is able to cover uh very well the um the all the production modes and the de- decay modes also here the mu mu is uh... a for which we only have upper limits is also 
included here. and finally, you have here in uh in this part, uh the common signal strength measurement by the the two experiments, the most recent ones. okay, 
so, um the the new uh somehow measurements are um are not any way satisfactory from 
several point of view. so, already doing Run one, a new framework was developed 
especially for the combination of the uh... measurements by the two experiments and 
from and different channels. so, this first attempt was the so called Kappa framework, 
which is basically modification of the Higgs coupling's vertex at the leading order, where one can express the production and the decay of the Higgs bosons 
in terms of Kappa modificators and then uh... feed these parameters. so, uh you have here um... 
one of these results by CMS uh for run two data which uh were in fact, no um undetectable invisible decays of the Higgs bosons are, um... are allowed. so, basically only standard model, uh decays to standard model particle, coupling to standard model particle are allowed 
here. and uh... you see that the agreement with the Standard Model expressed by the p value 
is very high. and also you have in a similar example, by ATLAS uh of the 
a measurement of the couplings where here you have three different interpretation in 
case of only a coupling to Standard Model and also when you allow um um Higgs decays 
to invisible final states, from Higgs to invisible searches, and also when you allow 
modification of the of the total uh width of the Higgs, um of the Higgs width from off-shell um... um width 
measurem- uh searches, um and you see, uh in particular that the Kappa modifiers have a 
typical accuracy which is of the order of ten to twenty percent uh for most of these parameters. 
now, um... more recently, uh a way also to... uh measure the Higgs cross sections and then make possible 
investigations on the B, beyond Standard Model contributions has been to uh measure 
the um the Higgs cross section in exclusive fiducial regions of phase space so called bins, 
under the simplify template cross section. later STXS. so, in these 
cases, what happens is that the measurements are done in reconstruction 
event categories as you can see on this part of the slide, and then these are 
unfolded at particle level in order to couple to the uh... phase space bins that we 
want to measure. so, why uh this is important is because, uh these definitions are common na- 
uh between the experiments and the theory. so, this helps, especially in the 
combinations and minimize the theoretical uncertainties and uh improve the experimental sensitivity to to this final state. now, I wou- like to present you an example of these 
kinds of STXS measurements by ATLAS of a uh from a measurement that was being released 
uh in April. and you can see for example, in in this uh plot here, uh as a function of the 
reconstructed event categories here, the purity of the different production mode bins 
that we have seen in the previous slides. and uh this uh in this analysis 
actually the number of um 
um categories is not particularly high because a neural network is used to um... to 
discriminate the different production modes. and in this particular search as 
you can see from the bottom summary, um the uncertainties are still dominated by 
statistical uncertainties. uh the the STXS measurements can be done on different 
stages from stage zero to up to stage two. and this particular depending on the number of 
bins and the granularity used for the fiducial bins, and you can see that this 
result is done in terms of the so called reduced stage one point one. in general, the 
agreement with the standard model is good as as again shown by the p value of a 
standard model uh agreement. so, um finally, um a way also to um... extract information about new 
physics, from the Higgs measurements is the possibility to, uh... to use effective field 
theories EFT and these allows to interpret the measurements extending the 
Standard Model Lagrangian with higher order operators of order six or above. and uh 
this is done for example in the in um... with the Higgs effective Lagrangian that uses 
the strong interaction light Higgs a uh basis. and you have here an example of how the... 
Wilson's coefficient related to these operators, higher order operators, can modify 
uh simplify template cross sections uh quite significantly, and that there is also an 
alternative uh um... let's say um... EFT um... um model that can be used which is a standard model EFT 
uh based on the uh Warsaw basis. and uh this, uh for example, is in um... yeah a show this plot 
show an example of how the electroweak Higgs production with two quarks um... the... uh can be 
modified in terms of PT of the leading jets by this um... by the by these um... higher order operators action. 
so, these uh in fact uh the STSX and the differential measurements are particularly 
interesting for these kind of operations and we are going to see now, some example 
of these. uh the first example is about the measurements uh coming from the in terms of uh 
Standard Model EFT coming from the Higgs to four leptons um... measurement that we have 
seen before and the these um he is in these cases the the m-... the measurement is not necessa- 
sensitive to all the possible operators. therefore, only the um Wilson's coefficient 
to which the analysis more sensitive are fitted and the others are just uh set to 
a nominal zero value. therefore, uh here you have a an example of the fit where only 
the relevant relevant Wilson coefficients are fitted. and then you can see in the 
bottom plot what will be uh the effect of these operator if uh if they're different from 
zero by these quantities. and this depends of course, depending on the category you 
can have one uh operator which is more important than others, and in particular, 
the one that are related to the gluon-gluon fusion are more sensitive to hg uh coefficient and and 
then the ones that for example are um... in the ttH um... bin of course a you are more 
sensitive to the couplings to the up type a quark. a similar measurement can also be 
done from the combination of different uh... from all he combination of the measurement. this is 
done by uh this ATLAS result. in this case in terms of the Higgs effective Lagrangian 
and uh therefore a different basis but equivalent and here you can see uh the 
results that are obtained for for these uh operators again, only the import- 
the imp- operator which uh to which analyses are sensitive is are shown. okay, so um... now, um I 
also would like to show you um a result from a differential cross sections. and again 
we have uh a new results, which was released in in April by ATLAS. and a both 
experiment have have done measurement in fiducial cross sections defined in terms 
of Higgs boson kinematics, jet, um multiplicity et cetera and the here from from 
this ATLAS measurement, you have an example of the differential cross sections, 
double differential cross section, in terms of the PT Higgs candidate and the number of 
jets.  so you see here that it's possible not only to make a differential cross sections 
in terms of one viable but even more than one. and also in uh in this case also from a 
Higgs to uh four lepton analysis, you can see uh uh instead, the differential cross 
sections done in terms of the rapidity distribution of the uh of the Higgs, which as 
you've seen from Sally talk before, is sensitive to the perturbative QCD prediction. 
so, um... then, uh another way to exploit the differential measurement is also to try to 
set limits on some of the Kappa parameters which are not easy to access directly. one 
of these example is the Kappa C so the couplings to the C quark. so this for 
example, is an example of how to use the uh the PT Higgs distribut- differential distributions 
in order to set limits on Kappa C and Kappa B. because um these 
are two um... Kappa parameters can modify quite strongly the PT Higgs distribution as 
shown in this uh in this plot here. so, uh therefore, um... these measurements can um... can the 
constraint can be set under different number of assumptions. here you have uh one 
o- of these uh uh limits, which actually is the most restrictive one that use the largest 
number of assumptions, where the modification not only to the shape of the 
PT of the Higgs, but also to the branching ratios. coming from these two uh Kappa parameters 
are are exploited and therefore, you have a better limit, but even if we only assume 
the... um... modification only to the shape of the PT uh of the Higgs, still, um... thi- in this 
indirect way we can still put limits on kappa C which is comparable or from uh of what 
we get from direct searches. okay, so, then the- there is still one more differential 
measurement I would like to talk about which is a uh d C- CMS measurements from Higgs to WW 
in the leptonic final states where the categories are defined according to this 
sub-leading lepton flavor electron or muon and the PT. and in this case the 
measurements, the differential measurement, is done in terms of 
the PT of the Higgs uh up to last bin goes above two hundred GeV and also number of jets uh above four 
four jets um and then you see uh that the uncertainty on the fiducial cross section 
is of the order of twenty percent and on the last the bin the the limitation is still 
mostly statistics, but still is um... we are gettin- we are getting there 
okay now, oh um 
I will discuss a bit more the Yukawa couplings. that um as I said before is a 
new kind of introduction that uh um can uh... can reveal a novel feature which are not seen 
in gauge boson interdaction uh and therefore, is um something that is been uh 
receiving a lot of attentions in the Higgs measurements. the first one will be the 
discusses the Higgs tau tau where we have the um a latest Higgs ATLAS analysis in the Higgs tau tau final state where six channels are analyzed and the uh... cross section is obtained 
from the fit of the um di-tau invariant mass. and you see that this result has been 
interpreted also in terms of um... simplified template cross sections for gluon-gluon fusion and 
VBF. and in particular for the VBF production model. this channel is uh, is 
particularly important thanks to its sensitivity. CMS has also uh shown the 
results whi- the also include more data than the ATLAS up two thousand seventeen. and in this 
case four channels has been analyzed uh and the Z tau tau is modeled in a data driven way. and instead of the m tau tau fit the uh the cross section is extracted from the uh neural a neural network distribution from a neural network distributions. in this case CMS provided a 
stage one simplified template cross sections for these channels. and you can 
see here the the bins in terms, for gluon-gluon fusion, in term of PT Higgs and for VBF uh in 
terms of VBF topology and etc. alright, so, the um another um... fermionic uh st- final state is the uh 
the the Higgs decaying to b quarks and the here they in order to reduce the the 
backround, usually they associated production with a vector boson is 
exploited. and you see uh a recent results by ATLAS from this year where in fact uh 
exploits a large number of signal regions and the control regions with a different charged leptons multiplicity in order to be sensitive to several final states and 
also a dedicated b-jet algorithm is used in order to improve the b b-bar mass resolutions. in particular the um these dedicated energy recon- uh recalibration algorithm improves by more than fourty percent uh the b b-bar mass resolution with respect to the 
standard jet calibration um... case. and the in this case, the simplified template cross section is provided in terms of the vector boson PT from in two bins from 
one hundred fifty two hundred fifty and above two hundred fifty. and this analysis uh is also quite sensitive to 
the these two production modes as you can see that in fact can achieve 
observation of the ZH production uh with more five sigma uh significance and als- in the 
case of WH it gets uh it achieves a very strong evidence of a four sigma. so, the-... now we'd 
like to discuss also a different way to also target the Higgs to b b-bar decay, 
which is to look for, instead of resolving the, uh the um, the jet from the b quark 
jets from the Higgs decay, uh reconstructing a large R parameter Jets and 
then look inside of it for the signature of it two b jets. so this is done b- by ATLAS 
and CMS with a slightly different target in the case of ATLAS  the target 
production mode is VH. like in the previous case, and the- the uh PT of the Jets has 
to be above two hundred fifty GeV. and you see 
you have just under five minutes. 
yes, thanks. and you can see here that uh its allows to give uh to achieve to extend their sensitivity in PT up to four hundred up to four hundred GeV. in the case of CMS, uh this is an inclusive search so mainly for uh targeting gluon-gluon fusions, and here the PT requirement of the jet is four hundred fifty GeV. but in and in this case CMS also uh f- try 
first attempt of differential cross section for the PT Higgs in this in this final 
state. and as again as you have seen from Sally talk before, uh this can be quite 
interesting in the future because while uh at low PT we are sensitive to the gluon-gluon fusion 
when we go after these bin of large PT we start to be sensitive also uh not only to 
gluon-gluon fus- but also to other production modes and therefore is this 
become quite interesting. 
okay, I just have one slide here about ttH for completeness, but I'm going to discuss 
more about these production more later, I just want to say that uh for this for the for 
this production mode-, that is um... from which we can extract the Higgs to top 
couplings directly, uh we are exploiting several decay mode of the t 
of the top anti top as well as Higgs decay modes. as you can see from this 
uh table from ATLAS and and CMS. so, um... now I will talk about the properties. so the 
first property I talk about is the Higgs mass measurements. and the Higgs mass is um 
is you know, is a question the naturalness Standard Model, since the- are the basis of the so called hierarchy problem but it's also an important 
parameter for the what concern the uh importing agree- for the electroweak 
fits. and also for the understanding of the stability of the vacuum as well as uh, to 
understand if the Higgs has a role as inflaton candidates. f- at LHC the 
measurement is performed in the two photons and four leptons final states because they 
have by far the best resolution and remind you that uh at the end of Run one, the 
combination measurements of the two experiments had um a precision of two hundred forty MeV. 
so I want to now to show you a new measurement by ATLAS that improves the 
techniques used previously by relying on event by event resolution method instead of 
average resolution. and also uh use a kinematic fit by constraining the invariant mass of the 
leading a lepton pairs to the Z mass in order to improve the precisions and use a 
double sided crystal ball to fit the the signal, as you can see here. so, this resulth 
is summarized in this table, and is a still limited by far uh by Statistics 
uncertainty in all the channels. and but I woul- luke would like to point out that the systematic 
uncertainty on this measurement is quite low is only ninety MeV and sixty, um... minus sixty MeV, 
which is mainly uh coming from the muon um um momentum scale. and also CMS has recently 
provided a Higgs mass measurement, this time on the uh di-photon using the di-photon 
channel with thirty-six inverse femtobarn of data and it's both in several categories. and 
uh in these cases, the signal is modeled with a um sum of up to four Gaussian function depending on the uh actual uh category and by itself this measurement has uh a 
accuracy of two hundred and sixty MeV, but when it is combined with the uh Run one CMS uh result, it 
achieve a total uncertainty of one hundre- forty MeV, which is uh very low is only about one point one per mill uncertainty. okay the last topic I'm going to talk about is the spin 
CP of the Higgs boson which, uh as you know, the prediction on the standard model is 
that the Higgs boson is a zero plus plus state and that alre- during Run one 
the coupling to the vector boson has been studied in at length, where the zero plus state was favored with respect to different alternatives, but um anyway is 
true that the Higgs to uh fermions couplings can also give us some more hints 
because in this case, uh the CP odd contribution can be on the same level of uh 
the CP even ones while in the case of the vector boson couplings are suppressed by uh 
the scale of new physics to the second power to the second power. so now, -ave uh, just 
to finish the results from the two experiments, which uh are done in the ttH uh 
where the Higgs decay to the photons final state. both results are very new coming ou- 
ou- came out in uh in March for CMS and April for ATLAS. and this result is a um... 
basically the parameter of interest is a is there a different between use a different 
definition by to explain, but they are equivalent in the case of ATLAS is the 
alpha angle here which ninety degrees uh is a full is a complete the CP odd state and 
in the case of uh a CMS instead the Kappa T tilda parameters is used and in 
particular, this is used to uh define the fractional uh CP even um contribution FCP. uh that is 
fitted here. so, Kappa uh T tilda ze- zero will be the Standard Model. okay, so here uh they 
in both cases the m gamma gamma is fitted in all categories and this is a 
summary of the results where both experiments can have excluded the pure CP odd couplings with more than three sigma three point nine pour ATLAS and three point two for CMS. and also uh... 
in the the case of ATLAS a fit of tH to ttH fraction has been performed 
giving a limit of twelve time standard model on the single 
Luca your time is up. 
yeah. and last slide. so just to conclude the, um... also ATLAS has a um a sensitivity to the 
Kappa T cosinus uh alpha sign um and the combining with the with the combination of 
the Higgs measurements. and uh... and then um... I would like just to... um give you the summary, 
uh saying that thanks to the outstanding performance of the LHC and experiments we 
run two, uh was possible to improve uh significantly our understanding of the 
Higgs um... bosons both in terms of production mode and as well as uh a CP structure and the 
Mass measurements and the- that run three and uh... run th- and uh in future run four and so and etc. 
looks bright, as you can see from these projections by the two experiments. thank you. 
great, thanks a lot Luca 
any questions? 
please, if you have any questions, feel free to raise your hand. 
all right. if not, then I had one. um back when you were talking about the EFT interpretations. um... I was trying to sort of um understand the differences between the 
ATLAS and the CMS results um that you showed. um in particular, like try to compare I was 
looking at hw and noticing that it seems that there was quite different precision. 
but you mentioned that these were coming from two quite different analyses. could 
you say a little bit more about the differences. 
um... the slide was... let me just get the number it was slide fifteen. 
yeah, unfortun-, okay with the the full screen mode. I think I'm a bit lost with a 
slide. but the, I think the point is that one has to realize that this 
were done un- under the different bases. so in one case, it was a SM EFT. and the 
other case was the Higgs effective Lagrangian, therefore, the parameters don't have the 
same meaning. so they are not directly comparable, let's say 
um... 
in uh 
D two. so, yeah. 
so that's the main reason now, I was just noticing that you had the comment 
that there was some strong anti correlation from the inputs in the CMS case. um... but I guess it's really the differed basis that are making the main differences. 
then you're also 
comparing I mean, the one on the right is from a combination of all the channels 
where the one on the left is essentially 
only ZZ four leptons. so 
yes, they in the case of the let's say, on the left, you are mainly sensitive to the 
Higgs to ZZ. therefore, here you have a strong, let's say uh sensitivi- to the b, which 
is basically the the the um gauge field um rate to the uh close more closely related, let's say 
to the Z. while instead uh yeah, the CMS case you have the combination, this is coming 
from the combination of the channels, therefore, you have a more complete vi- a com- 
complete pictures of uh of the couplings. yeah. 
okay, thanks. other questions? 
I see two hands are up. um but somehow, okay, um Michael spiri-. you want go ahead. 
okay, um because it was, I'm not really sure if I got it right. for the determination 
of Kappa C for the charm Yukawa coupli-, uh do you extract it from the 
gluon fusion cross section or from c c-bar to Higgs? 
in, well, this limit is extracted from the differential measurements from 
the PT Higgs. but, this also includes somehow the effect of the modification not 
only to the spectrum, but also to the branching ratios. therefore, has a bit more 
of assumption in the big Kappa, have um... somehow the limits when instead you 
only consider the um, the um... the limit from the, uh from the... um from the shape. now, I'm bit uh 
sorry, I'm a bit slow moving through slides, but they f-, maybe can jump quickly to um... 
to these results, just to show you. 
oops, I think I went too much ahead. 
um... 
okay, looks like I'm a bit um... 
a bit slow with moving through the slide. so, but 
um... 
ok. 
um... 
because the real reason why I'm asking is that I don't understand why the uh that the uh fit is symmetric 
for positive negative Kappa C. 
well yeah the fit is uh... indeed is quite symmetri-. now the... av- about the sign I 
uh... well, I mean it's symmetri- in the sense that there is no sensitive to the... to the sign yeah. 
yeah. 
so about that, uh I think only because enter quadratically no- I mean in the... in the... only enters 
quadratically in the... in the fit. 
yeah, but then of course, this cannot be the gluon fusion. this, uh because this must 
be done with c c-bar to HIggs. 
well, these are these also there is also, yeah, okay, there are also box of course 
there is a box uh... contribution as well. uh you have to consider this also is very 
sensitive to the Higgs plus jet, diagram. which is, let's say, box related. so yeah, 
it's not only... 
but again in the gluon fusion. 
uh... yeah, mainly I would say gluon fusion. 
I'll bet you are fitting an interference term basically, which is sensitive to the sign. 
okay, on this, maybe somebody can answer better than me. I'm, I'm... 
I'm really not ex- uh I can 
only tell you about the if the interference is a squa- or not 
because that's one of the deeper reasons of my question that I don't un- understand. 
uh um 
that I don't understand why this fit is symmetric with respect to the sign if this 
is coming from the gluon field. so this must be coming from cc bar to Higgs plus jets. 
then it's quadratic. 
well, I'm I'm... I'm sure that all the contributions are considering here. I am pretty sure 
that the gluon gluon fu- is one of the main ones to be honest. 
ah but then it must be asymmetric because then it's sensitive to the sign. 
I think Karsten might want to answer 
um... 
perhaps 
maybe he can't unmute 
I mean I know that the the limit is 
now I can. 
yes. 
can you hear me now? 
yeah! 
perfect. 
go ahead. 
so, um, the charm charm to Higgs uh is is included here. so this is really the... uh using the 
fully unfolded uh kinematic PT Higgs distribution or PT four lepton I should say, eh uh but the thing is um... 
um... due to low sa- 
resolution we had a have a lar- rather large bin from zero to ten GeV. if you go back to 
your original slides uh you see from like uh... the theory plot that a large fraction of the 
sensitivity comes even uh if you would split it even further from zero to 
five and five to ten. howe-, we didn't have the experimental statistics and 
resolution to do that. so so this is something maybe for the future or for 
gamma gamma channels and these kind of things. so in that sense uh it's it's all 
included here, but uh... yeah, we u- we only have a certain sensitivity with the current statistics. 
because it is also interesting because in the plots on the upper right, you'll see 
if you are comparing the green with the red curve that you are indeed sensitive 
to the sign. 
yes, but 
that's exactly the issue here and if you look at the upper right, um, the uh the 
main sensitivity from the sign is from if you compare zero to five and five to uh and 
above GeV in PT Higgs. and exactly what we are watching out by because we integrate from zero to ten. 
it was a limit, uh limited statistics and and resolution in in this and here 
the gamma gamma channel and if you try with a combination and also with a 
combination with CMS can help if we, if we make this uh experimental binning finer 
here, we will have still quite uh experimental um anti correlations between 
those but hopefully it's good enough to to make a better statement. 
okay, I think let's um leave the rest of this. discussion for the coffee break. I 
think um there was another question from Makkah. scalia. you want to go ahead? 
hello, if you could go on page twenty-six. 
okay, so so so I guess that the mass age pole and the mass top pole is different to the 
experimental measurement it means that probably you are doing some additional treatment and the the question is, when will theorist update this kind of plot with 
the most recent one 
okay, I think this is not a question for me, but maybe it's an open question for 
the theory at least in the in the room. uh well we know well the difference between 
the top pole and the so call mon- Monte Carlo, experimental top mass. okay, a I leave if 
any experimenters want to take this question. I will leave it uh I will leave to them. 
any theoretists. 
I don't see any hands. 
um... 
Ah spira you you'd like to take the question? 
I think that impossi- this issue is related to the um... uh because this related 
to the final fit of consistent top quark mass and this this is an enterprise that's now 
starting from the experimental side, because I think what you really have to do 
it this is one of the possible ways to fit the msbar top mass, uh or it was some consistent definition of the top quark mass and this is now starti-. the Higgs mass itself doesn't 
play such a big rule. but of course, I agree that the fit of the value of the 
top quark mass really is crucial here. and the first uh fits uh of as far as I remember is ATLAS 
consistent top quark mass are pointing towards uh the point that this ellipse moves 
a little bit more towards the absolute stability region but it's really uh in the 
vicinity of the border between absolute stability and meta stability. 
thank you. 
okay. 
ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. 
okay, hopefully you can see my slides, right. 
yes, perfectly. Thanks. 
okay. so thanks for staying around everyone... uh 
it's uh obviously a Friday evening 
so I can tell you a bit about some uh advances in CP violation in the B hadron system. 
so obviously, I didn't really set the scene too much with all the talks before. 
but as we know, the universe is dominated by matter and not antimatter. And 
it's a bit of a puzzle as to why that is and how to explain... how to explain it all. And 
of course, one ingredient then is CP violation uh, where you allow particles and antiparticles to differ. 
And in the standard model uh, in particular, in the quark sector, this is encoded uh in the CKM matrix. 
so we know there is CP violation. We've seen it in quite a few, quite a few places now. uh and the question is now where is the rest of it? 
I mean, if If you if you look at the amount of CP violation, you need to create all of the matter on the plot on the left there, what we have in the standard model, it leaves you is something like something like one, one galaxy. 
uh so we know there must be new sorts of CP violation out there at whatever energy scale 
uh. So uh the effects of new particles or new interactions, or a combination of both is what we're after this new physics. 
so obviously, I can't cover everything that's been going on since since the start uh of CP violation studies. so I'll try and cover what's, 
what's been going on in the last year or so. and for more information on many of the things I'll talk about, you can see these excellent talks from the parallel session earlier today, the flavor parallel. 
so starting with the unitarity triangle, you've seen this plot a couple of times already. 
uh so this is the famous unitarity triangle, it comes from basically multiplying two rows, or columns of the ckm matrix together and knowing whether they should equal one or zero 
and studies of this system so that the plot on the left, for example, give you a very precise test of the standard model. 
you can see if the triangle closes, you can compare direct and indirect measurements. and when these things if these things don't agree that's, that's your sign of new physics. 
so it's also worth mentioning that the total area of the triangle shown on the on the plot there is actually proportional to the amount of CPV in the quark sector. 
so the current status, as you've already heard is that everything is pretty much standard model. 
uh so then you can think, okay, what do we need to improve and 
the two, the two low hanging fruits at the moment are the uncertainties on gamma and alpha. so you can see these are the widest bands on the plot. 
um we've already had excellent progress from LHCb in particular in the last decade, and we can look forward to Belle two and LHCb in particular in the future. 
uh sadly I don't have anything to say about alpha today so that that will remain on the longer term to do list. 
so the current status of the angle gamma is that the world average is dominated by the LHCb gamma combination. 
So, the current gamma combination from H FLAV is shown on the figure here. 
And you can see in black is the world average and It also shows in the color some, some contributions from individual channels. 
and you can see that currently are uncertainties are about five degrees, and as I said, completely dominated from LHCb. 
and uh indeed, the the the LHCb progress is shown in the other plot here, 
we can see the uncertainties have shrunk quite drastically since 2013. they will continue to do so. 
however, there's been a couple of new measurements that aren't yet included in these combinations. 
so, this is an L H C b analysis using B zero to D K star zero decays. 
and this will provide a a decent improvement in the in the uncertainties from just the B zero mode 
and so this analysis is considering the a vast array of defined state. so your D meson is decaying to uh K plus pi minus. So here you have two charged combinations, one favored on one doubly Cabibbo suppressed. 
then you have the k k pi pi, K, three pi and also four pions. 
this analysis was done with the L H C b data set up to the end of 2016. So it's about five inverse femtoBarns. 
and effectively, this sort of measurement boils down to a counting experiment, you count how many B and B bars you have, and then you make 
you form some C P sensitive uh asymmetries and ratios uh of yields, which you could then interpret in terms of gamma as a second step. 
so just a couple of examples. this is the D to k k mode as shown at the bottom for B and B bar, as shown, and 
I should just point out that unfortunately, this nice big peak from the BS isn't actually the one we're measuring. 
this is the BS decay, we're actually looking at the smaller B zero peak. 
unfortunately, the SDKs are almost completely insensitive to gamma just due to the ratio of amplitudes. 
and Okay, you can see by eye here that things are pretty consistent between the too although you can see that the B zero is slightly higher. 
so this is a direct hint of a CP violation there. 
And just an another one to just flick up uh very similar plots for the four pion mode. 
but the power of analyses like this really comes from combining them together. so you measure the observables shown here, 
for all the different channels, don't focus too much on all the numbers uh at at this time of day, 
but you can see that um they are all basically consistent with zero at two sigma level. 
but when you combine these things together, you actually see we get some fair sensitivity to gamma. so you can see 
uh it has the standard fourfold degeneracy, this is this is expected from from these measurements just from the uh sines and cosines in the equations for example, 
uh but the dominant uh the the best minimum that the dominant minimum is indeed compatible with the world average of gamma. 
so then another analysis that also came out even more recently is the so called GLS analysis. 
these these acronyms are just the the named after the theorists who came up with the approach but basically what they mean is, which D decay you interested in. 
so in this case, we're now back to the B plus, which is which is the golden mode. and this analysis is focusing on the K short K pi decay of the D. 
And, this this includes the full LHCb data sample, which is about 9 inverse femtoBarnes. 
And here you can consider your analysis in two regions of the Dalitz plot, the phase space, of this D decay, so the K star region and the non K star region. 
so just for an example, the K star region mass plots are shown at the bottom of the slide here for the B and the B bars... the B plus and B minus. 
and the sensitivity to gamma in this mode is a bit less than before so we don't actually interpret this on on its own. So the, 
the observables you see on the on the side of the slide here, will just go straight into the next LHCb gamma combination where they will help constrain help constrain things further 
so changing tack a little bit to another one of the angles from, 
from the unitarity triangle so beta. so now now we're talking in the realm of time dependent CP violation. 
and this is an LHCb analysis of B to D star D, again, using the full 9 inverse femtobarns. and considering the decays as shown, so the D star to D pi plus, 
and then two two choices of the D decay for the D zero decay and the standard favored three body decay of the of the D minus meson. 
and what you want to do ultimately here is measure the CP violation observables from the time dependent decay rates. this is just one of four possible decay rate equations. so there are four of them, I just show one. 
And they basically differ by sign flips as you'd expect for CP. 
and to get to that stage, you need to perform a mass fit first. so examples of these for the run two dataset are shown 
on the slide and you can see the two body has a very nice fit and very low background. and in the four body, so the D to K three pi mode the background is larger. 
and this is just because you have, you just need to add more tracks together, so you can make more random combinations in the so called Commodore background. 
but nevertheless you see a very sharp signal peak and then everything is well under control. 
and when you take the signal only part of these distributions, you can perform your fit to the lifetime as shown in the plot on the right. 
and so the coefficients we're interested in of these decay rate equations are the terms that pre multiply these cosine and sine terms, 
which are from the mixing. and there's also this A F F term out the front, which is a sort of global asymmetry between the two, two final states. 
So this is your sort of direct CP violation, as opposed to the stuff coming in through the mixing. 
and it turns out really, what you want to do is make a combination of these coefficients from the previous slide. 
and so the the the observables we're really interested in are these S delta S, C delta C and the B as I just mentioned 
and LHCb measures these to be shown which excludes CP conservation at 10 sigma. so, different observation of CP violation. 
And these are the most precise measurements now in this channel surpassing the efforts from from the B factories, 
and just the plot on the right I never get tired of looking at these beautiful plots that really show you in a picture the oscillation of the of the B and the B bar 
uh for the two different uh final states uh available. 
okay, so now, staying with time dependency B violation but moving from the B zero to the B s, 
so this time we're now talking about phi s or minus two beta s as it's approximately related to 
and uh C P, uh sorry, and in the in the from the C K M unitarity you can get the prediction for minus two beta s phi s and you see that 
you get a very small number. so we're looking for something close to zero. and it's also constrained very, very precisely. 
And it's also worth noting that this is an interesting place to, to study because 
there's still room for up to 10% differences here from new physics effects. 
and then on the other side of the slide, you can see the uh direct measurements. 
So this is the the status during after run one of the L H C. so you can see C M S Atlas 
and L H C b here along with C D F and D zero from the Tevatron. 
and the uncertainty you can see is over an order of magnitude larger than the numbers we want to compare to from CKM unitarity. so that's, that's the challenge. 
Luckily, we already have LHC run two. so uh the proponents of these analyses have been busy so this is 
the first update was LHCb from from the spring last year. so this is 
a run two update with 2015 and 2016. so here now you're interested again in 
the golden mode, B S to Jpsi K K or B S to Jpsi phi as you're mostly interested in in the narrow phi resonance. 
so LHCb actually choose to bin the phase space around the phi meson in the beam shown further down on the slide. 
uh we have over hundred thousand candidates. and you can see how pure the mass distribution as well is in the plot in the middle here 
and this is a time dependent analysis. So we need to know whether we start with a B zero s or B zero s bar and this is uh achieved through the flavor tagging. 
and effectively what it boils down to is that LHCb has now reached a flavor tagging efficiency of around five percent. so basically, you have to times your 
hundred twenty thousand by a factor of five percent and that is your statistical power to measure the CP violation. 
so we perform a full angular analysis. So this includes six dimensions or so, the B mass, the decay time, the decay time error, and three decay angles. 
and whether the decay angles are just defined as the angles between things like the decay plains of the J psi and the phi. 
and we fit data samples simultaneously. 
and the results that fall out for run two only are as shown, 
so a statistical uncertainly of point four one. So already quite close to the, the run one, LHC average. 
uh and then of course, it's also combined with the run two result as shown on the slide here. 
and then further combined with the other L H L H C b measurements, um, where you can see that this is the most precise in pink, 
but there is also decent sensitivity from some of the other modes that Jpsi pi pi and also jpsi k k where you you look at the higher mass region instead of phi. 
LHCb is not the only player in this game. and there's also a recent update from Atlas uh again with part of they run two data sets. so 
everything up until the end of twenty seventeen and from as you'd expect from the GPDs so Atlas has a huge signal yield getting up towards half a million decays, 
although you can see they do pay a price in the purity, the purity is much lower, but you can see from the plot that uh everything seems to be pretty much under control there. 
so, the flavor tagging here is again more difficult, although they're getting up towards two percent. so, again, we see some promising promising performance 
and the fit generally works fairly similar to the LHCb one without without some of the bins 
and also a couple of the other parameters are fixed and then varied as systematics, 
but nevertheless, we see uh good compatibility with a measure of measurement of phi s indeed they're run two uncertainty is the same as the one from from LHCb, 
although you can see the systematic is a couple of factors higher uh 
but nevertheless uh, very, very impressive results. 
Uh it is worth mentioning there is a small tension in the value of gamma s which basically reflects to a tension in the lifetimes. 
but this is uh still to be uh 
we will see how this goes with more data of course. 
and Atlas of course also would like to combine this with the run one measurement. 
and you can see on the slide here what an impressive update this run two result has been moving from the from the blue to the green, and then combining them in the red. 
so you see very competitive um uncertainties there. 
So, the status somewhere through last year was uh to reduce the uncertainty from point zero three one to the new LHCb and new Atlas results, 
uh already reducing this uncertainty by a factor of a third. So that was that was easy. 
and then a new result to be added that hasn't been added to the to those nice plots yet is the spring update from twenty twenty for CMS. 
and again, this is their large part of their run two data set, so up to so twenty seventeen twenty eighteen so 
something like nearly hundred inverse femtobarn and you can see from the plot again, 
the purity is very good similar to the LHCb measurement. 
although I should mention here there's only something like fifty thousand fifty thousand decays. 
um the strategy taken by CMS was to optimize uh the flavor tagging uh, the flavor tagging efficiency rather than the the pure signal yield. 
but when everything shakes out, you can see that the uncertainty on phi s is again very competitive to the the LHCb and and Atlas measurements. 
...in the selection they have their their flavor tagging is up to ten porcent. 
and uh these results are in good agreement with previous measurements and the others. 
and again, one can combine this with the run one results and they get the very competitive results as shown on the slide. 
okay, so that was phi s and the unitarity triangles and now we can move to a little bit of discussion about CP violation in B baryons. 
So, Baryon CP violation is expected, when you look at the diagrams isn't there's no real differences to the the mesons in most places. 
So uh obviously, we were looking for this. 
and L H C b has made a few studies in the past few years about this. so for example, they've looked in two body charmless decays. so, 
such as P K, p pi, so P K is the one shown on the on the top of the slide here. 
And you can see by eye that the particle and anti particle plots are very similar. so, indeed, that was a hint that we didn't see any CP violation there. 
we also consider the four body decays where you have a rich, rich amplitude structure. so you might think there's some some more space for CP violation to appear here 
and looking at the Lambda beta to p three pi mode evidence was seen a couple of years ago for C P violation. 
And although obviously it's just over the threshold, so an update was needed there. 
and that came last year, or at the turn of the turn this year, in fact, over the Christmas break, basically. 
so this is now L H C b including run two up to the end of twenty seventeen. 
so about a factor of four in the signal yield. And obviously that gives you about a factor of two in sensitivity. 
uh with now a signal yield getting up towards thirty thousands events. 
so there's a couple of techniques used here to try and measure the CP violation. 
the first one is the so called triple product asymmetries, where effectively what you try and do is come up with these scalar triple products, 
they're defined as shown, which is basically just ways of combining the momenta of the final state particles in your in your, in your decays 
once for the uh particle decay and once for the anti particles decays. 
and then you can stop some asymetries here based on the signs of these these things and uh you atke uh the difference and the sum 
and do this again, independently for the particle and the anti particle decays. and then the final step is to combine these into asymmetry terms. 
so one uh on the left here as shown for the C P violating asymmetry and another alternative parameterization which gives you the parity violating asymmetry. 
and uh so, when when you turn the handle and have a look what you get, we find that from the triple product asymmetry results 
C P violation is is, well C P is conserved rather at uh more than uh two point nine sigma, 
although parity violation is observed uh at five point five sigma, and this is shown pictorially in these plots Don't worry too much about the binning schemes here. 
just compare whether or not the red points for C P or the blue points for parity whether they are compatible zero or not. 
and you can see that on average, the blue points do do sit away from this line, which is why we see this parity violation. 
but unfortunately on average, the CP uh seems to be consistent with zero. 
and uh one can cross check these results using the energy test method. 
uh so I don't really have time to talk much about the energy test method. 
but effectively what you're doing is using a, it's a statistical comparison of two data sets. so effectively the particle anti particle decays 
using the test statistic shown on the bottom of the slide. 
uh but the results here are just completely consistent with the triple products. so unfortunately, we don't confirm the hint of, the evidence of C P violation in these modes. 
So the final topic I would just like to briefly mention is C P violation in three body charmless B decays. 
so there was some very exciting results back in twenty fourteen now, 
where huge localized CP violation is seen. so this is the Dalitz plot of B to three pi decays. 
where this is the Dalitz plot is just a representation of the decay phase space. 
and you can see the z axis here ,the colors, uh represents the raw asymmetry between the particle and anti particle decays, 
and you can see some really crazy numbers here, you're getting towards hundred percent C P asymmetry in in regions of the phase space, 
which was uh quite a surprise at the time, so generated some interest whether this could be caused by rescattering or various other other ideas. 
but really, uh from from the experiments side, you need to perform an amplitude analysis to work out what's going on. 
and this arrived last year uh with about twenty thousand candidates. 
and so the the goal of the goal is to parameterize, the amplitudes in this this phase base contributing to this decay. 
and this is done with the amp-. This is done with the isobar model, where the isobar model is really just a coherent sum of the contributing amplitudes. 
so the notoriously tricky part of this analysis is to model the S wave. so this is the spin zero component of the pi plus pi minus amplitude. 
so this is done in three different ways you have the isobar model, with a additional rescattering term. so this is a new feature for this analysis and nice inclusion. 
there is also the k matrix, which is fairly infamous in itself now, and has five rescatting couplings to various different intermediate states. 
and a nice thing that's come back into fashion over the last few years is this quasi-model independent analysis. 
so here, you're really just saying, what is the magnitude and phase uh of the of the spin zero component as a function of my phase space. 
and so you can see the plots for the magnitude of this amplitude for each of the three cases at the bottom 
and you can see that there is C P violation in each case, the blue and the red are, B and B bar 
and you can see that uh C P violated and all of these 
and you can see that quantitatively there is decent agreement between the magnitudes 
more tricky is to get the phase motion right. and you can see that uh the phase motion is slightly different in the isobar model, which you would expect 
uh it's not the the the most complicated model in terms of getting the phase motion, correct. 
Uh but nevertheless, uh you know, features are identifiable in all of these. and the differences are taken as a as a systematic. 
so there's too many results to go through. and in fact, they published two papers at the same time. so that gives you an idea of what what was included there. 
but just to focus in on some of the the obvious C P violation results, 
there's these quasi two body, C P asymmetries, so this is just saying how much CP violation do we see in some of the regions of the phase space. 
and there are some large numbers here, so over forty percent in the F two twelve seventy region. 
And there are also some nice effects in the rho region. if you look at the the integrated number for the rho looking at the the the symmetry there you see basically nothing 
but if you consider the C P asymmetry as a function of the lower half of the peak and the upper half of the peak, so you split the rho into two bins. 
you can see that you see huge C P asymmetries they just happen to almost completely cancel out as you consider the resonances as a as a single item 
and this is uh just a nice way to show that you can you can miss these things if you if you just integrate things 
and this is probably coming from uh interference between the the S wave and the rho. 
and uh then just to talk about the the F two region is the one shown on the on the on the side of the slide now, so, on the top is the mass projection, 
you can see there is some small discrepancies, but these are covered by the systematic uncertainties. 
and the plot to really look at is again the C P asymmetry which is shown at the bottom here. 
and you can see very significant CP violation here. 
just before I just before I finish, it's worth mentioning that uh these decay modes these three body charmless decay modes can, in combination be used to measure uh things about the C K M matrix, so gamma for example, 
but really this is a standalone study of the C P violation in this single decay at present. 
So the summary is that a lot of work has been going on in CP violation. 
and I just want to make the point I think, in you know, regardless of the outcome of 
these very interesting flavor anomalies that are going on CP violation is and will always be an excellent precision test of the standard model. 
and and we are due to reach some truly interesting sensitivities in the coming years. 
we have the L H C b and also L H C full run, full run two data samples to look forward to. 
And also the belle two and L H C b upgrade will be entering the game. 
and the there are of course, plenty of other C P violation topics out there that I didn't have time to talk about. 
uh but just to quickly flash up one last thing before before I stop talking. 
uh looking forward this is just some projections from L H C b but also including Belle two and Atlas and CMS as well. 
So you can see that the gamma combination we will be at the end of grade one region about one and a half degrees, this will already be exciting precision, 
Belle two will join us at the same sort of place. and then we get to something pretty ridiculous at the end of upgrade two. 
So I should say these are these predictions also do include the systematic so they should be the ultimate numbers we reach. 
and again, phi s also becomes very, very interesting in these later later dates, so thanks very much. 
thanks a lot, Mark. We have time for small questions. 
there is one in the attendees. 
hi, can you hear me? Yes. Okay, so uh 
it's Martin speaking. I have a comment about the CP violation measurement using the lambda B D K 
if you show at page twenty three 
Okay, so, so uh basically in the previous paper, publishing on nature, uh they published the evidence of CP violation 
to deliver all something more than three sigma, and there was no evidence for p violation 
uh now, of course, the same poll uh, increasing statistic by a factor of four about that is a partial correlation of course no, 
and the now they have something less than three sigma for C P V that I don't think is an issue since it can be just a population, 
but five and five sigma for P violation. so uh I think that may be could be worth to quantify the compatibility between the two results may be running the old analysis on the new data set, or vice versa. 
Yeah, okay. Yeah. thanks for the comment. I uh yeah, I don't know too much more, too much more than what you've said myself. 
I I think Julian did mention in his, his talk earlier that uh they had done some tests, but uh perhaps perhaps some of those those numbers could be made made available. 
we discussed this morning or basically they perform some check on this compatibility between the two CP violation measurement and they found that the agreement is at the table two point six sigma so, I think it's okay three or something 
versus two and eight to a nine of course, is you due just to rotation 
uh i think that that i don't i don't know actually what was the the uh the result for the P violation in the natural uh but now five and five sigma is quite quite large. 
So of course, they have more statistic can be just due to, to, to these new sensitivity and so on maybe just just to just to check, 
yeah, okay. and okay. I guess the I guess maybe maybe the analysis will be done with twenty eighteen data and the future as well and, and beyond that, so yeah. worth worth keeping in mind though. Thank you 
are there more questions 
uh one question. on your very last slide you showed, I was a bit surprised. 
Uh I mean, CMS has an effective taking power of up to ten percent why can't they be much better if I ask 
what is limiting? 
So, yeah, I'm also not hundred percent sure if if someone from CMS is connected and wants to 
wants to talk a bit more about their projections that they're working to chip in. 
uh so, 
I do know that CMS will also perform their analysis using the part of the data set they haven't used yet, which is the high statistics low tagging power. 
but obviously that should be somehow complementary uh. 
yeah, I I'm I'm yeah I'm not too sure about this limiting of around twenty two million rads 
or not. 
okay, I I I can comment uh, if you uh, if you want, uh please, 
Uh basically ten percent of tagging power you saw in the presentation uh of today uh is obtained by selecting a sub sample of the full statistics 
with a with an additional muon. So we uh is a muon enhanced some way. 
So we have uh the two muons for the J psi and an additional muon uh for the tagging. 
and we select these sub sample at trigger level, so it's a ni uh tagging power, but the statistics is low 
so so what what do you know number, a rough number of how much lower the statistic can, five times lower uh, okay, okay, so and then we will uh exploit the full data set with the full statistics 
also. so if you fold that in this magic ten percent go down to two percent 
yes, exactly. Okay, thanks. 
So I now I understand the numbers better. 
I don't see any more question and it's already quite late in the afternoon. 
Let's uh thank Mark for the virtual clap. Okay. Thank you. Thanks a lot and move to the last presentation 
Okay, and I hope you can 
also see my screen now 
is that am I projecting alright? 
Yes, you're projecting right. Excellent. Okay, thank you very much. I get started then. So um, 
the last talk of the session is on VBF and VBS measurements. And I'm afraid I'm gonna 
have to start with the caveat that actually there's no such thing and the 
reason for that will become clear on the next slide. So if I go straight to slide two, 
so V B  VBF and VBS - vector boson fusion and vector boson scattering - really 
is the sort of diagrams that I've illustrated here on the on the left hand column, 
um the scattering at the top and the vector boson fusion um at the bottom, 
um but these cannot be measured by itself. So there's a gauge invariant set of electroweak 
V or V V JJ diagrams at tree level, which includes the diagrams on the right and 
they're more like weak boson bremsstrahlung. Um and these two types of um diagrams at tree level 
they interfere strongly with each other and they interfere negatively 
with each other. So, the only thing that we can actually measure is electroweak VJJ or VVJJ production. 
So when we say VBF or VBS measurements, this is really what we mean, 
this complete set. And so this is quite interesting. So, the dominant background 
here is typically the QCD V plus two jet production or uh diboson plus two jet production, 
um where you have two additional parton emissions um from from the strong interaction. 
So this is in the in the VJJ case, this is the dominant background, it's essentially 
like Drell-Yan with two additional um parton emissions if you think. Um so in that sense also 
the electroweak component is actually part of the NLO electroweak correction, which 
also makes this whole thing very interesting from a phenomenology 
perspective um to be able to measure this precisely and really test the um 
high precision um calculations and test the Monte Carlos really properly. There's also a mixed QCD electroweak contribution in between This is interference term. And so far, most 
of the measurements haven't really been sensitive to that. But this will become a 
significant component. And it's sort of estimated to be ten to fifty percent in the one to four TeV range. 
So I'll come back to that later. Okay, so why is this interesting? So the the, 
the thing that I've already mentioned is that these interfere strongly and 
negatively, but also, this interference is really delicate. Um so if you look at the 
integrated cross section, as a function of the centre of mass energy, and this is 
illustrated here and this plot that I pulled from Michal's paper, um this is for 
eh same sign WW production and in particular looking at the longitude eh the um longitudinal component. 
And what you see is that eh if you were to fiddle with the couplings, this is 
super sensitive to that. So this is the Standard Model is, in black here, is going 
down. There's a delit, delicate cancellation between all the terms but if 
you were to, say, remove the the Higgs component um contributing to that process 
then the whole thing, is this at the top, then completely blows up and diverges as a 
function of centre of mass energy. So, the only reason really that the unitarity is 
restored by this is through this eh delicate cancellation of the various terms 
contribuing t, contributing to this process. And this is not just true for 
variations in the Higgs coupling where this is very sensitive but this is also 
you see a similar sensitivity when you start playing around with the triple or quartic gauge couplings 
um as indicated in the two bottom plots. Eh so measuring this very precisely, 
is really absolutely crucial in order to fundamentally test the electroweak sector and 
gauge symmetry of the of the Standard Model. 
Okay, slide four Sorry it appears to me 
that it's not full screen, could you try to put full screen? 
uhm let me try 
is that full screen now 
No. Still. 
Okay. If not, don't worry. I mean, it's clear enough if it's not possible, let's 
go on. Yeah? Okay. Sorry about that. 
Um okay, so I'm on slide four now. And so eh what dos eh what does this look like? So, 
typically, if you if you think about the sort of tree level process again, you have 
your two incoming quarks, each of them sort of pops out a W or a Z and then 
these two fuse or scatter. And uh but other than that your two quarks 
essentially just continue into the forward direction of your detector. And so you end up 
typically with two forward jets with uh a large rapidity interval and this is illustrated 
here eh at the top left plot, this is in case of ZJJ, comparing the electroweak with 
the QCD red, and you can see that for the blue signal, for the electroweak ZJJ the 
the rapidity span between the two tagging jets tends to be much much larger. Uhm because 
you have a T channel exchange of a colour singlet between the two quarks uhm the 
additional radiation in the gap between the two jets is also heavily suppressed. 
And so you would expect no additional jets in the gap and you can see that in the 
plot in the middle. So this is the number of jets in the gap and for the blue signal 
most of them sit in the zero jet bin as we would expect whereas for the QCD like 
background, we have additional radiation in the gap uhm and the you know kinematics of the topology then are 
also such that because you have two forward jets and the central boson, or two central bosons 
you typically have a very hard uhm dijet invariant mass and this is shown on the 
top right the MJJ, the dijet invariant mass distribution, is much much harder in case 
of the electroweak component then compared to the QCD eh background. Eh on the bottom, 
I've also pulled a uhm event display from a Z Z JJ recent em paper and you can nicely see 
this here. You see the two forward jets along the axis and then the two electrons and the 
two muons in eh in green blue 
Okay, slide five 
em so the rest of the talk is essentially I'm going to the most recent of these 
measurements, I'm showing here, the Standard Model production cross section 
overview of Run two alone and you see the electroweak V and VVJJ measurement here 
bottom. And mind you this is an eh a quite astonishing plot because this is going 
over essentially fourteen orders of magnitude, which is eh mind blowing really, if you think 
this is essentially like comparing the weight of uhm of a super jumbo Airbus here at the 
top and then you're still sort of you're still able to pin down individual grains of salt 
from the last holiday pre corona if you still remember that. So this is the 
sort of grains of salt measurements that we're now looking at. Okay, eh I will now 
start with weak boson fusion. This is eh the larger of the cross sections, of course. Eh so 
here's a very fresh result from Atlan from ATLAS on eh slide seven. And from eh ZJJ. 
And so the first thing I want to talk about, and these are sort of patterns that 
em are relatively common between all of the different measurements, uhm is the background modelling. 
So for ZJJ, the most important variable in this analysis is the 
dijet invariant mass spectrum. And if you look at how do the various generators model the MJJ spectrum, 
this is illustrated in the plot at the top for the control region. Uhm it's bad. So this 
is all over the place. Different generators are shown in blue. You can see this for 
Sherpa, which is known to overshoot massively at high MJJ, but also eh NLO 
leading order Madgraph also don't do such a great job. And this is the the point is 
also that the missmodeling between the different generators is much much larger 
than the size of the electroweak component which is indicated in red bottom. So what 
do you do? Well, uhm, if you if you do the analysis, typically what is done, you 
build control regions and you build different control regions and validation regions 
and em probe the modeling in all of these and this is in illustrated in the 
in the plot in the middle, looking at the MJJ distribution in different eh control regions, 
but also in the signal region. And in this case, this is looking at 
Sherpa. eh and what you can see is a massive a data prediction discrepancy. So the 
modelling is crap, but the modelling is similarly crap in all of the control regions; 
which is good at least they're consistent. And that is quite important 
because then you can really correlate between the different control regions and 
constrain the modeling and eh transfer that constraint using the data into the signal region 
in order to constrain thee the background modeling there. And if you do that in 
a fit, then, the one at the bottom is what you end up with, where you really 
constrain the modeling and the MJJ looks fine afterwards. 
Okay. 
em more details on that in Heather's talk. I'm afraid I can't go into too many details 
here. Em but just to say uhm that eh because you're playing around with this, one of 
the crucial things you always have to keep in mind is that in addition to just 
trying to extract the electroweak component is also crucial to measure the inclusive 
eh V plus two jet production, so the QCD and the electroweak in one go 
eh in addition to extracting the component. 
okay, slide eight. So this is what's been done. And I'll start off with the 
inclusive measurements in this case. So here I'm presenting inclusive Z plus two jet 
cross section measurements from this analysis and they measure 
fiducial differential cross sections as a function of MJJ the Delta rapidity between the two 
leading jets, the dilepton mass spectrum and the signed uhm azimuthal difference 
between the two jets. And they measure that both in the signal and in the control region 
in order to be able to later on constrain the modelling and improve the 
modelling of the Monte Carlos. So in these plots, em the data as compared to multi 
leg predictions, at next leading order from both MEPS AT NLO using Sherpa 
but also FXFX using Madgraph. And you can see the modelling as a function of MJJ being 
bad, more bad for Sherpa, but also not too great for Madgraph, in the control region 
here on the right and in the signal region in the middle and the delta phi JJ 
on on the left. Okay, so then once you have done that, you can subtract the 
background, the QCD background, and also measure differential cross sections for 
the electroweak component. And this is what's done on the next slide. On slide nine. So, once 
the background is subtracted, here's the fiducial cross differential cross section measurement 
as the function again of MJJ, delta y j j, the dilepton PT and the 
azimuthal difference between the two jets in the signal region for the electroweak component, 
and here the data is compared to eh predictions, all in the VBF approximation, at NLO from Herwig 
seven em and from Powheg eh and as well Sherpa. So what you can see is, this is actually 
known for a while now that the Sherpa two point two series has issues with the 
description of the color flow in the VBF topologies. So what happens is that the 
pattern shower radiates way too much into the the gap between the two tagging jets. And 
because it has too much radiation, the events tend to em fail some sort of jet 
central jet like veto eh cut that the eh analyses typically apply. And that 
depletes the cross section as you can see it's typically a factor of two everywhere. 
on the other hand, Herwig seven does best in those distributions. And the analysis also 
measures integrated cross section and this is really an excellent agreement with 
the Standard Model prediction taken from Herwig. Okay, slide ten. Now once you've got the 
differential cross section measurements and the Standard Model prediction, then the question is, 
what else can you do with that? And the answer is you can play some with some EFT constraints with 
this. So what's typically done here is that you take the Standard Model prediction 
and then you supplement it with eh dimension six operators. So there's four 
it turns out that are relevant for the couplings in ZJJ, two of them are CP 
even two of them are CP odd. And what the analysis has done here is taking the Standard 
eh pure Standard Model prediction and supplemented it with the interference of 
standard model and dimension six EFT operators but also the pure dimension six contribution 
estimated both with eh this SMEFTsim package but also Madgraph at leading order. And 
then they set limits on eh on these four eh operators both with the dimen 
pure dimension six term included and excluded. The difference actually typically not that 
great and it's very similar. You can see this also in the plots here for the 
different em eh bins measured eh as a function of the in a signal region you can see in the 
eh purple and then the red two difference between having the pure dimension six operators 
or not is rather small. what you can also see is that is quite important to measure the 
azimuthal difference between the two jets as a signed one so between minus pi and 
plus pi because the CP odd terms uhm they have such a form that if you had put an 
absolute value around it, this difference would have been completely washed out. So 
you're gaining additional sensitivity here eh by defining this in the signed form. Okay and 
the limits are presented here at the bottom. One eh one funny feature that you can see 
is that for one of them the Standard Model is actually outside the ninety five percent confidence interval. 
But then if you take into account of the look elsewhere effect you find 
that is em more or less expected so there is six point two percent chance eh for that to happen when you 
constrain these four operators. 
Okay, so this was uhm weak boson fusion. I'm now moving on to weak boson scattering. 
So a lot of final states of course, so brace yourselves. I'll start with same sign 
WWJJ production and WZJJ production. This is a result from CMS now. Em it's a similar em topology thing, 
again, where you have a large em rapidity interval between the two 
jets, going hard on the on the dijet invariant mass distribution and there's some sort of 
eh central jet veto applied, or eh lepton centrality, which is kind of related. There's a 
b quark veto as well in order to suppress distributions from eh contributions from top 
processes. Uhm the QCD and the electroweak em same sign WW and WZ processes 
respectively are all calculated in this case at leading order using Madgraph Pythia. And you 
can see the dib the distributions here at the top and em in case of same sign WW, and at the 
bottom, eh for WZ. Em in the left, on the top you can see the MJJ distribution, also on the 
bottom MJJ distribution. And on the right you see the dilepton distribution, 
the dilepton invariant mass distribution for same sign WW. At the bottom you see a eh 
the score of the boosted decision tree that was trained in order to eh suppress the 
background and extract the electroweak component. Okay on slide fourteen then, this was 
fit to the data in a em binned maximum likelihood fit and that was used to 
extract the electrweak component. Em and you can see the integrated cross section measurements 
here. They are in very good agreement with the theoretical predictions. 
And the dominant systematic uncertainties are coming from the jet energy scale, but also the eh theory 
uncertainties particularly dominated by the QCD scales. And in addition, they measure the inclusive 
em same same WWJJ cross section, so QCD and electroweak combined, as well as the WZ 
inclusive WZJJ cross section. And they compare that to eh next to leading order predictions, 
actually they compare that to the Madgraph predictions with and without the 
NLO corrections for alpha S and electroweak. You can see the effect at high MJJ 
starting to set in. Okay. Moving on to ZZJJ. So this is going down quite a bit 
in cross section now. This is a fairly recent ATLAS result. They've done eh this in 
both the four lepton jj channel, but also the two charged lepton two neutrino jj channel and 
and here the background is simulated at next to leading order with Sherpa 2.2 and the 
control region similar to the ZJJ are then used to constrain the modelling of 
this Z Z plus two jet component. They use a multivariate discriminant in order to 
em extract the electroweak ZZJJ common eh component and in practice this is using a 
gradient boosted decision tree here and the eh the impact of the interference, and this is 
also similar to the ZJJ analysis I was discussing before, the impact of the 
interference is assigned as a systematic on the electroweak sig signal. Eh this is something 
that ATLAS does quite often actually. Eh again, systematics largest impact from 
theoretical uncertainties is up to thirty percent for the QCD component. And the results for 
this on slide 16. So, eh the extraction of the ZZJJ component is shown at the top 
for the two channels and if you combine them as well and this is a eh five sigma result 
and after combination, so, this makes this the first observation of this really 
rare and important process and the distribution for this shown on the right in the two charged lepton 
two neutrino case at the top and the four charged lepton eh channel at the bottom. Again 
they also measure the inclusive cross sections, not just the extraction of the 
component and the inclusive cross sections are in very good agreement with the Standard Model prediction. 
Okay, slide seventeen. This is also a ZZJJ results from CMS. This is brand 
new. Uhm so, here this is em using a calculation that actually isn't using the VBF approximation 
but includes the the triboson components. This is the sort of 
full electroweak em calculation em and the background the QCD ZZ JJ is done with FXFX 
from Madgraph a MC at N L O at next to leading order using various k factors, 
em differential k factors to eh correct the predictions for NNLO QCD effects as 
as well as electroweak corrections as a function of the eh diboson invariant mass. They use a matrix 
element discriminant 
sorry Christian you have five minutes left 
okay I should start speeding up then 
they use a matrix element discriminant in order to extract the background and the 
results are shown on slide eighteen. Again measured in inclusive cross section 
in addition to extracting the electroweak signal and all of those in good agreement with 
the Standard Model and you can see the the distributions here. And the typical effect 
of the electroweak component more towards high MJJ and large delta eh eta between the 
two jets and these are the most em effective ones in discriminating between background 
and signal which goes into this matrix element classifier, you can see the signal 
out here. 
Okay, I'm starting to move on. Z gamma, JJ from CMS. This is also not too recent, 
eh fairly recent result sorry 
Similar story here. Madgraph used for at leading order for the electroweak signal and 
at NLO for the QCD. Eh and the results shown here this is split up across 
different eta JJ bins and MJJ bins. And then in a em simultaneous fit to all the 
control regions all the signal regions em they measure the signal strength and extract the the 
fiducial cross section for both the inclusive Z gamma JJ but also the electroweak Z gamma JJ. 
And this here the electric component agrees within two significant with the 
Standard Model. Not to forget the ATLAS result from the end of last year 
They've done a similar thing here, they measured again also the electroweak component for 
Z gamma JJ and the inclusive cross section as well, all in good agreement with the 
Standard Model. And then the final result that I really wanna talk about so I have to speed up is also brand 
new from CMS W gamma JJ. Em so, this is em also using again a control region in order to constrain 
the modeling of the MJJ. Here they're looking at the low part of the MJJ and then 
similar to Z gamma j j. They split this up into the electron and the muon channel but 
also in the barrel part the lepton being in the barrel part or in the end cup. And 
looking at different M L gamma eh bins as well. And in the simultaneous fit to all the 
control and signal regions, they extract the signal strength and this em amounts to 
four point nine sigma observed four point six sigma expected with the two thousand sixteen data set alone. And if you 
combine that with a previous eight TEV result you hit the five sigma mark and that makes 
this the first observation of W gamma JJ at the LHC. And again fiducial cross section measurements 
for both the inclusive W gamma JJ as well as the extracted electroweak component. 
Okay, this is also then used to set limits on anomalous quart eh quartic gauge couplings 
showing you the full list here. Unfortunately, I don't have too much time to go 
into all the details here but you can see all the details tomorrow in Mariarosaria's talk. 
So, what I will do is I will leave you with my summary slide, which is 
I hope I could em convey to you that measurement of VJJ in VVJJ final states are 
really a vital probe of the electroweak sector. Em this is very interesting as the 
unitarity bound is achieved here through delicate cancellation of different terms 
contributing to these processes. And so em it's important to do this. But also 
measurements of inclusive V plus two jet jet and VV plus two jet production are 
eh really a stress test of perturbative QCD eh when you look at the VBF and VBS topologies 
and so it's important to not just focus on the actual extraction but 
also to look at the inclusive measurements and crucially em to make the 
data then available on HEPDATA and to provide a Rivet routine so that we can really understand 
the background modelling and pin this down even better in the future. So I encourage you 
to look at Heather's and Mariarosaria's talks tomorrow and leave you with that. Thank you. 
thanks for this very interesting talk Christian. So now that is Shankar who has 
asked the question And I will allow him to speak. Please. Could you please? 
Yeah. Hi, Christian. Thanks for this excellent talk. So I have a question. 
Actually a few questions. Eh eh so number one is eh in your in your VBF analysis, so you 
produce ah z plus jets. So I just want to ask ah a few questions here. So z plus jets, 
do you also consider like z plus single jet and z, like ah in a merged sample when you 
are generating everything together? So I'll ask the other questions together so that 
you can ah answer everything. And eh isn't Higgs plus jets also ah a background here? And if 
so, like Higgs going to di tau is is one of the like, biggest backgrounds in that 
sense. So in that case, do you use or do you plan to use something like a 
collinear mass variable to differentiate between the Higgs plus jets and the z plus jets. So 
these are my two essential questions. Thanks. 
Thank you. Can I just clarify, you're talking about the ZJJ result yeah, not the VBF 
Exactly. The Z JJ results Exactly. 
Right. Okay. Let me just go back. So the Higgs isn't really a background, 
because in the in the selection for Z JJ, you can actually want to actually tight 
fairly cut fairly tightly on the Z mass. And so the Higgs doesn't really play a role then 
anymore for the background studies, and the other question was on the accuracy of 
the background component, 
the other was like mostly the modeling of z plus jets. So do you also look from your 
Feynman diagrams, I see that you generate z plus jets, which is the the quark quark fusion but 
do you also include z plus single jet or just z production and like include a merge sample 
while while modeling the modeling the sample? Yeah, 
these are on atlas at least, em always done with merged samples so the the Z JJ is at is 
em next to leading order accurate, so this is Z plus zero one or two jets at next to leading order 
and on top of that even the third and fourth jet at leading order merged. Thank you 
so much. 
Okay, so Are there additional questions? 
If not, since we have two minutes I have one slide the seventeen in which you em em say in 
which you say indeed that the largest impact comes from QCD scales up to 
eleven percent. So, I wonder in comparison with the ATLAS measurement if there is no
