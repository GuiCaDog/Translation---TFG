ATLAS collaborations and she will present studies of exotic states. so Liupan you can start. 
okay, thanks. thank you for the introduction 
so it's a great pleasure to share with you the study of exotic states on behalf of LHCb, CMS and ATLAS collaborations 
so exotic states are hadrons beyond the conventional mesons and baryons which are allowed by the Quark model 
various candidates for exotic states like the XYZ particles and the pentaquark states have been observed so far 
they can provide new insights into the internal structure and dynamics of hadrons 
and serve as a good platform to study the non perturbative behavior of QCD 
and many interesting results on exotic states have been made during the last year 
in this report, I will introduce several studies of X thirty-eight seventy-two, and searches for exotic states 
in particular, there are two new results on X thirty-eight seventy-two from LHCb which just appeared on archive yesterday 
as the first observed charmonium like exotic hadron, X thirty-eight seventy-two has the most abundant experimental information 
its mass is inconsistent with the prediction for chi C one two P 
and its decay to psi rho is isospin violating, 
which suggests it has an exotic nature 
and the most intriguing property of X thirty-eight seventy-two is the proximity of its mass to the D "oh" D "oh" star threshold 
and it is measured to be narrow with the natural width smaller than one point two MeV at ninety percent confidence level 
there is yet no consensus on the nature of X thirty-eight seventy-two and experimental studies of its production in collisions and in weak decays 
its line shape and its decays can provide valuable information on it 
using the "uh" full run one and part of the run two LHCb data 
the lambda B to X thirty-eight seventy-two P K decay was observed for the first time 
its signal yield is determined from a two dimensional fit of the J psi pi pi P K mass and J psi pi pi mass 
to be fifty-five plus minus eleven which corresponds to a significance larger than seven sigma 
and the P K spectrum of the signals is studied, which indicates around fifty-eight percent of the decays proceed through the lambda B to X thirty-eight seventy-two lambda decay 
and its branching fraction is measured relative to that of lambda B to psi two S P K times the relative branching fraction of the Jpsi pi pi decays 
uh which is five point four percent 
and using the CMS data corresponding to one hundred and forty inverse femtobarn at thirteen TeV the B S to X thirty-eight seventy-two phi decay was observed 
its signal yield is determined from the two D fit of the J psi pi pi mass and K K mass 
two hundred and ninety-nine signals are obtained with a significance larger than six sigma 
and the background subtracted mass distribution of X thirty-eight seventy-two phi is checked 
from which the fraction of non non B S candidates is determined to be one point seven percent and subtracted 
the branching fraction of B S to X thirty-eight seventy-two phi is measured with respect to B S to psi two S phi 
and with the known values of the branching fractions of the psi two S modes 
the branching fraction of B S to X thirty-eight seventy-two phi times the branching fraction of X to J psi pi pi is determined and found to be consistent with "uh" that of B "oh" to X thirty-eight seventy-two K 
however, the branching fraction ratio of B S to X thirty-eight seventy-two phi to that of B plus to X K is almost the two times smaller than that of the psi two S modes 
it indicates the X thirty-eight seventy-two formation in the B meson decays is different from that of psi two S, suggesting X thirty-eight seventy-two is not a pure charmonium state. 
"uh" using the full LHCb run one data, the X "uh" the line shape of X thirty-eight seventy-two is studied using candidates reconstructed from the hadron decays 
the mass scale is calibrated using data sample according to the well known resonances 
and the mass resolution model is developed using the simulation and cross checked with psi two S channel which has a much higher statistics 
and the J psi mass constraint is applied. so the mass resolution is dominated by the kinematics of the two pions 
and the considering the dependence of the mass resolution on the "uh" pi pi momentum 
the fits are performed in simultaneously like in three P pi pi bins separately for two thousand eleven and two thousand twelve data 
and first a Breit Wigner line shape is assumed from which the mass splitting between X thirty-eight seventy-two and psi two S is measured 
and with the known psi two S mass 
the mass of X thirty-eight seventy-two is determined which differs from the D "oh" D "oh" star threshold 
by zero point zero one plus minus zero point fourteen MeV 
and its width is measured to be one point thirty-nine MeV 
while to account for the opening up of the D "oh" D "oh" star threshold close to X thirty-eight seventy-two 
the Flatté line shape is investigated from the fit the mode and the full width at half maximum of the Flatté model are determined 
its peaking position is measured to be consistent with that of the Breit wigner line shape 
however its "uh" FWHM is a factor of five smaller than the Breit wigner width 
as can be clearly seen in the comparison of the two line shapes 
well, after considering the detector resolution, they become consistent. and this highlights the importance of a physically well motivated line shape parameterization 
and to investigate nature of the X thirty-eight seventy-two state, the analytical structure of the Flatté amplitude is studied in the vicinity of the D "oh" D "oh" star 
and two poles are found in the Flatté model. one on the physical sheet and the other one on the unphysical sheet 
according to the positions of the two poles 
the quasi bound state of D "oh" D "oh" star scenario is preferred 
and based on this scenario, the binding energy is determined to be smaller than one hundred keV at ninety percent confidence level. 
however the first pole is also allowed to be on the unphysical sheet at two sigma level 
so, the quasi virtual state assignment cannot be fully excluded 
and a quasi bound state can either be a molecular state or compact bound state. 
and in the case of a dominantly molecular nature of the state we expect a single pole close to the threshold 
while in the case of compact bound state, 
there should be two nearby poles 
so the asymmetry of the two poles can provide information on the X thirty-eight seventy-two composition 
and the relative fraction of the compact component is determined to be fifteen percent from the best fit and can reach thirty-three percent at the largest 
while using the full run one and run two LHCb dataset the X thirty-eight seventy-two in the B plus to X K decay is also studied 
around four thousand signals "uh" obtained from the two dimensional fit of the J psi pi pi K and J psi pi pi mass uh distributions. 
and also in this measurement the mass scale and mass res resolution are controlled using the data samples 
and its branching fraction is measured relative to B plus to psi two S K to be three point sixty-nine percent 
and the mass and width of X thirty-eight seventy-two are also measured based on the Breit Wigner line shape 
and here the two figures show the comparison of the measured Breit Wigner "uh" mass and width of X thirty-eight seventy-two 
the red points show the results of this measurement and "uh" the line shape study 
we can see before these two results only upper limit is set on the width of X thirty-eight seventy-two 
and here the orange band shows the new world average whose precision is significantly improved by the two new results 
and by averaging all the LHCb measurements the mass of X thirty-eight seventy-two is measured to be thirty-eight seventy-one point sixty-four which differs from the D "oh" D "oh" star thresholds 
"uh" by zero point zero seven plus minus zero point twelve 
and the width is measured to be one point nineteen plus minus zero point ninety MeV 
and besides the study of "uh" the existing "uh" exotic states the search for new members is also interesting 
for quarkonium like exotic states, "uh" the XYZ family is already quite rich 
while for the pentaquark states only the U U D C C bar pentaquark states are observed at LHCb in the lambda B to P C K decay with P C decay to J psi proton 
the confirmation from other experiments or in other decay modes is watery important "uh" and there are also chances to see the isospin or strange partner of it 
theories also predict the existence of fully heavy tetraquark states which tend to be compact bounded 
and provides a golden system to investigate the inner configuration of multi quark states 
and they are usually described with the di-quark model 
the ATLAS experiment "uh" performed a study of lambda B to J psi P K decay 
"uh" using the run one data from which around two thousand signals are observed and 
hypotheses of two pentaquark states, four pentaquark states and no pentaquark are considered. 
the data prefer the two or more pentaquark states scenario, but the no pentaquark model gives a P value of zero points ninety-one percent. 
so, it is not fully excluded 
and the mass and width of the pentaquark states determined from the two pentaquark fits 
are consistent with the measurement of "uh" performed by LHCb 
and using the CMS data corresponding to nineteen point six inverse femtobarn at eight TeV, 
the branching fraction of B plus to Jpsi lambda P is measured with respect to that of B plus to Jpsi K star 
which is the most precise to date and the B plus to Jpsi lambda pei 
"uh" Jpsi lambda P decay can target low mass pentaquark in the Jpsi proton system 
and new resonances in the Jpsi lambda combination 
the invariant mass distributions of "uh" lambda P, Jpsi proton and Jpsi lambda are investigated and found to be inconsistent with the pure phase space hypothesis shown as a black dashed line here 
but consistent with contributions from the K star 
however, the presence of new resonances cannot be ruled out. 
and "uh" using the CMS data corresponding to sixty inverse femtobarn at thirteen TeV "uh" the lambda B to Jpsi lambda phi decay was observed 
"uh" from which the signal number is determined from the fit to the K K mass distribution with the background subtracted according to the fit to the Jpsi lambda K K mass distribution 
and the signal number is determined to be two hundred and eighty-six 
and its branching fraction is measured relative to that of lambda B to psi two S lambda 
and the observation of the lambda B to Jpsi lambda phi opens up a window on the search for new resonances in the Jpsi lambda and Jpsi phi mass spectra. 
CMS. Liupan, you have still three minutes. 
Okay, thanks. Oh 
yeah, the CMS "uh" experiment also searched for the tetraquark states composed of B B B bar B bar in the Upsilon one S mu mu decay mode 
within the seventeen points five to nineteen point five GeV region using data corresponding to thirty-five points nine inverse femtobarn at thirteen TeV 
and here the figure on the left shows the mass spectrum overlaid by an example of the fit with signal 
while the signal significance is only around one sigma. 
and throughout the whole mass region, no significant excess "uh" from the background only model is observed 
so upper limits are site on the production cross section of this tetraquark states timed time times the branching fraction of the tetraquark to Upsilon one S mu mu decay 
versus the mass of this "uh" state based on different signal models. 
So, in summary, during the last year, "uh" fruitful results on exotic states have been made 
our knowledge of "uh" X thirty-eight seventy-two is much advanced 
"uh" its production in the B decay suggesting the non conventional charmonium nature 
and we have "uh" largely improved the mass and width measurement of "uh" of X thirty-eight seventy-two based on the Breit wigner line shape. 
and we also try to study it using the Fla Flatté line shape 
and also the data show good possibility for discovering new exotic states 
there are new channels with potential for "uh" discovery of charmonium like exotic states emerging and "uh" the search for fully heavy tetraquark states has been started. 
that's all thanks. 
thanks a lot Liupan for this very nice talk and for staying exactly in time so 
"uh" now it's time for question I "um" recall that for question attendees should press the raise hand button 
to book for a question and then you remember that they have to lower the hand after the the question is finished 
so let's see there are 
I don't have a button for raising my hand but I would like to make a comment 
this is Marek 
yes Marek because I we have to promote you to cross that's why you don't have the button. But please go ahead with the question. 
Can you show "uh" transparency number thirteen. again, please, "eh" 
so in this transparency, we have a schematic depiction of "uh" fully heavy tetraquark. 
and I just want to comment that there is more or less consensus that such things probably do not exist as stable states 
but there is also consensus that there are tetraqu, fully stable tetra quarks 
which contain two heavy quarks and two light anti quarks, those most likely do exist and are accessible experimentally. And I'll try to say a few words about them. 
actually, I think, according to the data, quite some theoretical models predict the existence of these fully heavy tetraquark states. 
well 
the the there are some of them 
yeah, there are some but I think by now there is consensus that it's impossible to have a fully heavy tetraquark, for example, with two B's and two B bars 
which would be below the two eta B threshold. 
It can be below two Upsilon threshold but not below two eta B. 
okay. 
yes 
Yeah, but there are there are there are indeed various predictions. So I think without a a complete experimental study of this, it's hard to give a conclusion 
and the search for this can also be important. 
well, experiments are always important, even if all of us disagree 
It's good to test the theoretical consensus I'm just saying that there are good reasons. 
yeah 
to think that such things cannot not can never be below two eta B threshold or two eta C threshold 
but of course experiments are the final arbiter. 
nah okay. yeah, thank you. thank you very much for the for the comment. 
Are there other questions? I don't see hands raised so I 
Andrea, sorry "eh" it is Martino, 
okay Martino, please go ahead if you have a question. 
curiosity on page eleven two pages before 
"eh" ok and and the same applies also to the the other the first analysis you you you presented. So "uh" these two variable you're using in the two D fit are strongly correlated. 
so, I assume that you need a full two dimensional fit. no? you cannot factorize the two. 
for example, in in the CMS analysis you showed before 
"um" we will do variables that are uncorrelated for the yes two D fit. 
"eh" in this case, you I think you have a a full PDF with not not factorization I mean 
"uh" in this measurement when they calculate this Jpsi pi pi invariant mass they "uh" they have applied a mass constraint to the B plus 
okay 
In this case they have removed the correlation. 
understood okay 
yeah thanks. 
And the same thing is true also for the lambda B. 
"uh" 
I think it should be 
okay okay 
but actually I I I think even if there is no such constraint the correlation should not be large 
but you have a Jpsi pi pi for one variable and Jpsi pi pi plus other two "uh" 
tracks so in principle you think that the 
end some some correlation between the two distributions 
okay but then 
yeah, in the sense of the different components maybe the correlation is also not that large. 
start when you want 
okay 
so good afternoon. uh, thank you for allowing me to make this presentation. 
I will present the Atlas upgrade for the next years. 
can I 
okay, I need to change the slide to this. 
so let's go on slide two. 
um, let's start with the uh, LHC and High luminosity LHC plans. 
at the moment we are in, uh, uh, long shutdown two 
there are some changes on LHC essentially regarding the magnets and the uh injection system 
and we will have also some upgrades in ATLAS as well that I will discuss. 
uh run three is also known as ATLAS phase one. 
um, another long shutdown will be after run three that will uh bring us in the so called high luminosity LHC era 
that will see more improvements on injectors 
more protons per bunch better focusing, and an instantaneous luminosity 
up to seven point five times ten to the thirty four 
we expect to collect around three thousand inverse femtobarns on data 
and of course, there will be some ATLAS upgrades as well. 
in this case, uh, this upgrade is I mean this phase is called phase two for us. 
So let's move on slide three, um 
Let's see which is uh what is the impact of luminosity on the experiment essentially, uh for phase two, 
the requirements are that all the parts of the experiment have to stand uh at the peak luminosity of seven point five times ten to the thirty four 
and to keep good physics performances at least at least as good as uh uh run two and run three 
This means to keep an acceptable trigger rate uh to keep low PT thresholds and also to mitigate the pile-up. 
We expect an a an average pile-up of two hundred collisions per bunch. 
um which means larger event sizes event uh higher trigger rates, higher detector occupancy 
readout limitation and and reconstruction complexity. 
But also uh uh the detector has to stand with high radiation uh levels, which means 
increased radiation damage and uh increased activation of materials. 
let me now uh show uh a very short summary on the main physical motivation for the upgrades. 
This is not representative of the entire uh Atlas physics program for the next year for the next phases 
uh there are a lot of presentations on the Atlas physics program on the upgrades in this conference, 
I just noted some here and here. 
uh essentially, I want to mention just that there there'll be ma many studies on the precision measurements and rare decay searches on the Higgs boson 
uh and also on the Standard Model processes the study of rare decays like uh the search for the Higgs in two muons 
and also the search beyond Standard Model uh that may be concentrated for example on exotics and susy programs and also dark sectors. 
Let's move on slide five. 
um and so we start talking about ATLAS phase one upgrades these are the upgrades 
uh that I will discuss and this is also the the the loc these are also the locations in the detector. 
Let's move with the new small wheel detector on slide six. 
The new small wheel is uh uh made of two five meter radius wheels in the endcap region 
covering uh region of eta between one point three and two point seven 
each wheel is formed by two external uh small thin gap chambers TGC wedges 
that are used mainly for trigger for bunch crossing identification and for vector tracking. 
And internally they have two uh micro megas wedges, 
which are used mainly for tracking with a spatial resolution uh less than one hundred microns. 
On the right top you see the layout of the two wheels 
uh the the for for the large and small sectors, 
uh the chambers are built in Institutes in four different continents. 
uh this gives you an idea of the huge effort that the experiment has put in this project. 
And which is the aim of the new small wheel, the aim is to reduce the fake muon triggers in the Endcap region 
by making a coincidence between the existing detector, which is the big wheel and the new small wheel. 
uh you can see it here in this plot in the right middle, where you see some tracks and some particles that are that can be rejected by using the new small wheel system. 
Essentially, if you have these three tracks, you can trigger only on the A track while you can take out the tracks like B which produces only hits in the in the big wheel. 
And also tracks like the C where you have hits in the big wheel and new small wheel but with the uh, with the track, it's not pointing in the uh uh to the interaction point towards the interaction point. 
So maybe that's been produced by some other kind of direction. 
On left bottom, you also see the trigger readout schema for the new small wheel system. 
It's a very complicated schema. uh electronics is also based on many custom boards custom elements. 
The schema goes from the front end here uh on the on the left to the uh off detector right. 
there are four custom asics developed for the system for the front end. There are many front end boards. 
There are boards sitting on the rim of the wheel uh this one reported in the in the pink box. 
And there is also off detector electronics which is essentially based on A T C A uh modules. 
On slide seven, let's move on the new small wheel status. uh the, about chambers and electronics for the first wheel, 
uh on Side A. uh they’re already produced and are on track also for the second. 
And indeed, uh many electronics parts have already completed their production 
the integration activities are in full swing for both for Micromegas and for S T G C. 
as you can see in the pictures on the left. uh when I say uh uh integration I mean assembly installation connections but also 
software uh for D A Q and triggers as well they’re they're being developed 
prior to COVID uh uh break it was on track for installing the first wheel before the end of the year. 
And but you may see here uh in the bottom uh right uh that the two sectors are already installed on the wheel since March. 
Let's move on the other up on another upgrade on slide eight, the B I S seven eight upgrade uh 
We just saw that new small wheel will cover a region in eta between one point three and two point seven uh 
while the big wheel covers a region between one and two point seven. so, there is an intermediate region between one and one point three that is not covered by the new small wheel. 
and and this region is only partially covered in the large sectors by the existing uh so called E I L four T G C endcap chambers. 
So the idea of the experiment was to install the decision was to install new detectors in the B I S region. So only in the small sectors 
in order to reduce the foreseen uh fake rate. 
uh this upgrade is made of sixteen R P C chambers with that are thin gap uh R P C triplets with one millimeter of gas gap instead of two 
front end electronics and also, uh the uh existing six sixteen M D T uh detectors will uh will be replaced 
with small M D Ts that are drift tubes with diameter of fifteen millimeters instead of 30. 
And uh uh the detector production is ongoing As you may see on right picture photo, the 
this is an R P C triplet in uh in B B five site and uh also the installation of the A side in principle 
was was was scheduled to be done by summer maybe this is still the case while the the C side is postponed um 
Yes, the C side installation is postponed until long shutdown three. 
This is also an important project uh, which is a pilot project for 
phase two because the same M D T and R P C detector technology will be used when 
the the barrel inner layer will be equipped. Let's move on slide nine, 
the upgrades on the liquid argon calorimeter and level one calo trigger system, uh there will be new front end and back end uh boards for the calorimeter. 
These will allow to increase the trigger tower granularity and have a good trigger performances even at the high pileup. 
uh so this is the the granularity for run one and run two and this is the new granularity for run three. 
The aim of course is to keep a a a low trigger rate thanks to the background rejection 
and low thresholds thanks to the um high geometrical resolution which is increased 
um about the level one calo trigger and readout system. uh you can see the full schema here on the bottom right. 
uh there are three posters on these um on these items um on next Thursday 
and essentially the the main feature are the new feature extractor boards, the electron jet and global 
that process the data from the um electromagnetic calorimeter at a higher granularity. And 
in this case they will perform more refined processing with respect to the previous runs, 
and also to have a better discrimination between the photons, the electrons taus and jets. 
uh of course, you can find ma ma many more details on these three projects about slide 9 uh 10 uh 
About the full uh T DAQ phase one upgrade. As I said, there will be an upgrade on the level one calo. 
uh there will be also an upgrade on level one topo, which is a new board that performs topological algorithms 
on data coming from calorimeters and muons in the end cap region uh there will be the new uh sector logic board endcap sector logic board it will receive inputs 
from the new muon detectors. That's why we need a new board. 
uh uh the new detectors are the new small wheel muon system and the R P C B I S 
and also uh inputs from the outer layer of the uh tile calorimeter the extended uh uh barrel of tile calorimeter 
there will be also poster on this on next Thursday and uh all these inputs will be used in order to reduce the fate rate in the endcap as I already said 
about the central trigger processor uh new muon to central trigger processor interface boards will be uh built. 
These will manage the data transfer from the new boards. So essentially from Level one Topo and new endcap sector logic I already discussed 
and also uh will have more resources in order to process data and higher bandwidth uh to be tran uh to to by using optical links essentially. 
about readout system uh there will be the new Felix readout system it acts like uh a router between the custom front end links and commercial, multi gigabit network technology. 
In order to transfer data to the appropriate destination. It interfaces with the timing trigger control T T C system and the busy system. 
It will be used in phase one for the upgrades I already described. 
The new small wheel B I S seven, eight and the liquid argon upgrades 
but will be also the standard system for the phase two so for run four, 
okay. So, we are ready to move to uh phase two. uh these are the uh items I will discuss, and their position in the experiment. 
The first is new all silicon inner tracker also called uh I T K. 
uh the current ATLAS inner detector uh was designed to operate for ten years at the luminosity of ten to the thirty four 
at an average pile up of twenty three and the level one rate of of one hundred kilohertz 
uh of course using it at the high luminosity LHC era will bring increased occupancies and bandwidth saturation 
and also radiation damage. And so for this reason, uh a new all silicon tracking system has been designed. 
It's made of two subsystems: the strips which cover uh a region in eta up to two point seven 
which is made of four barrel layers and six endcap discs 
and the pixel subsystem which covers uh a region up to eta four and is made of five barrel layers 
plus inclined modules plus barrel and endcap rings 
the aim of I T K is to reach equal or better performances than the existing detector in a much more difficult tracking environment 
and for example, to keep a high uh track reconstruction efficiency and low rates of fake tracks. 
Just to give you some numbers on slide thirteen, I want to give you some numbers and photos. 
To give you an idea about the huge I T K project the pixel 
have more than ten thousand modules more than thirty three uh thousand front end chips 
more than ten to the nine channels, and also strips have roughly ten uh eighteen Ks uh modules and almost sixty uh millions of channels. 
These are some photos or some designs of how the the the project is is uh evolving 
uh let's move on slide fourteen. About liquid argon calorimeter. 
The the current electronic is not compatible with phase two requests essentially for latency and trigger rates 
as we will see uh later. and also the radiation requirement for Phase Two are above the original design. 
So the idea is to uh keep the phase one upgrades boards, 
but also build the new front end and back end electronics. uh in order to to to read the the the detector at full granularity, 
and send the data off detector uh to the back end at fourty megahertz. 
uh there's a poster on this. There was also a presentation today about the high granularity timing detector H G T D 
it will be used to mitigate the pileup. uh and so, to use high precision timing information to distinguish between collisions, 
it will be installed in a space between the inner detector and the uh calorimeter endcap 
so essentially in this zone and it will be based on silicon low gain avalanche 
detector technology that will be used also by C M S. And with the timing resolution less than fifty uh pico seconds 
it will improve the forward object reconstruction uh by complementing and helping the tracking capabilities of the I T K in the forward region essentially, 
but we’ll be also used for online and offline luminosity. 
Let's move on slide fifteen. Another calorimeter the tile cal uh It's made of steel plates and plastic scintillator tiles 
uh for the phase two upgrades uh a complete replacement of on detector and off detector electronics is foreseen 
because of mainly two reasons uh radiation damage and aging and but also to be compatible with the T DAQ uh requirements 
new architecture requirements and transfer the full data off detector uh optically at forty megahertz. 
Moreover, the roughly ten percent of the photo multipliers, uh the ones reading out the most exposed cells will be replaced 
the i is foreseen an upgrade of low voltage power supply and also the high voltage distribution system. 
And this is the full acquisition schema for the tile cal and the project is in a very mature state and preproduction is expected already this year for several subsystems 
tens of five minutes left. thanks uh let's move on the muon detectors on slide sixteen. 
uh just to give you an overview of the system the upgrades foreseen for the muons have two main objectives 
to reduce the trigger fake rate in the barrel and the end cap region 
and to increase the geometry coverage in the barrel. 
In order to do this new detectors will be installed uh in the barrel the uh R P Cs plus S M D Ts so if you look at two pictures on the bottom, 
uh on the left for the small sectors, the old uh B I S M D Ts will be replaced with the new small M D Ts plus R P Cs exactly like the uh B I S seven eight project 
while in the large sectors the new RPC detectors will be mounted on top of the existing B I L uh M D Ts, because here we have a much more space 
also in the end cap region, the T G C E I L four uh detector will be replaced. 
uh at the moment there is a doublet there will be a triplet in order to allow more robust coincidence algorithm. 
structures here that create a coverage holes in the barrel middle layers, as it has been for run one and run two and will be also in run three 
And so these coverage holes will be covered by these new layer of R P Cs. 
Let's move on slide seventeen. 
uh for the level zero muon trigger. 
Uh so the data from the R P C T G C and new small wheel detectors used uh in Phase One 
will be complemented with the new detectors with B I R P Cs with the E I L four T G Cs with the tile cal 
uh tile calorimeter outer cells and with the small M D Ts 
uh by looking at the top left plots, we obtained two objectives essentially we are covering all the regions in eta. 
So, essentially we are uh increasing the geometrical acceptance on the barrel from seventy eight percent to ninety five percent. 
And we al can also reach an increased selection efficiency in in reducing the fake triggers by making more robust coincidences 
In order to do this also the muon detectors boards uh will be designed and installed 
they will allow full digital detector uh readout. So the data will be sent off at forty megahertz sent off detector 
The bottom block shows the trigger readout schema for the muon spectrometer, the barrel and endcap new uh off detector sector logic 
Will perform the trigger algorithm as usual. But now the system takes the advantage from the higher latency and so also the M D T trigger processor is used 
will be designed and used in order to help in mu identification and fake trigger rejection 
and as I said the readout data are then sent to Felix uh once the event is accepted and validated 
let's move on slide eighteen, the T DAQ system in phase two. uh 
This is a very uh uh short overview. uh in the picture, you see what is called the the baseline schema for the T DAQ. 
It's a two level architecture. The first level is the level zero where the central trigger processor receives it ends in two minutes thanks 
receives data from the muon system and calorimeters for Level zero level zero muon. It issues a level zero accept signal 
which is the pink arrow which is sent back to the detectors and then data are read out 
by the inner tracker the calorimeter and the muon system to Felix. 
The second level is an high level trigger H L T. And here uh it is made of processor farms, a custom hardware called H T T 
that uses the tracking data to refine the trigger algorithm. 
The trigger rate has to be at one megahertz It was one hundred kilohertz in run one and run two the latency has to be less than uh than ten microseconds. 
it was two point five microseconds in run one and run two and the permanent storage has to be performed at ten kilohertz, 
uh under consideration is also level zero level one architecture which will allow to scale system later if this is required by the physics uh 
or by the L H C perf um H uh H L L H C performances, but the system has to be designed now, in order to allow also an evolution. 
Let's just focus on the level zero architecture. 
uh there will be additional data from calorimeters and from muons for the level zero calo together with the new phase one upgrades these three 
there will be also another which is called the F FEX or forward features extractors 
For the muons the data from the new small wheel will be also complemented with the data from the M D Ts 
and also for for the R P Cs to improve the trigger coverage efficiency. 
A new system will be the global trigger uh that will perform offline like algorithms on full granularity uh on calorimeter data. 
It will makes uh use of uh topological criteria such as clustering, or photon and electron identification and isolation 
for the central trigger the muons to Central trigger interface designed for phase one will be used also for phase two only the the firmware will be upgraded 
while the new central trigger processor will be developed and designed for phase two 
about the DAQ and high level trigger the detector readout will be done at one megahertz 
which is ten times Vincenzo time is over this is my last This is my last slide 
um the readout throughput will be to be five point two terabytes per second which is twenty times more than today's 
the DAQ system will be based on Felix the data flow will make buffering event building and recording data 
and also the event filter as I said is based on hardware track trigger, 
which is based on the associative memories or F P G As. 
And these are my conclusions So, essentially the the large data set that can be collected will allow to perform a lot of precision measurements 
uh both in the exploration of uh standard model and rare standard model processes and for new phenomena 
the phase one upgrades are and phase two are uh well ongoing phase one is already almost completed and ready for installation 
while phase two upgrades is in the prototype state uh design state. If you want more details here, I put a link with all the uh published T D Rs 
Thanks. Sorry for being late. 
Okay, thank you Vincenzo. Thank you for this rather extensive talk. I'm sure there must be questions. 
Remember to raise your hand 
there are no question. I want to ask you one thing I didn't get. Yes. So what is the status now for the new small wheels of the micro mega detectors, 
what is the status of the installation? 
Okay, the micro megas and also the T G C, the full new small wheel system, uh was a high priority task. 
So even during the uh CERN uh uh COVID crisis say uh there was a task force 
that uh was still working on the on the assembly and installation and connections, 
even when the number of people allowed to enter CERN was very low. 
Then since last week I think much more people entered. 
I'm not sure uh 
if the if another uh sector was installed, so the idea is to install more uh first uh the small sectors 
like these two and then the largest. uh but of course if you want i if you ask about micro 
megas, micro megas has to be sandwiched with the T G Cs. 
So uh it's a matter of uh having everything at CERN and then to put uh everything back uh together 
to make the uh all this stuff that I tried to to to put pictures here and then install on the wheel. 
I think that uh there was not too much uh delay on the new small wheel because it was a high priority task. 
I don't know uh much more details in reality. Okay, thanks. 
So time for one question. 
doesn't seem to be any so we thank Vincenzo again of course virtual once more. thanks. and then we move
