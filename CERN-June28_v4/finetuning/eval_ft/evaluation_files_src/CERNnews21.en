Relive 2021 at CERN.
Highlights of the year at CERN, from exciting particle physics results to accelerator milestones and much more
With LHC’s Run 3 around the corner, it has been a year of milestones at CERN!
Accelerators saw their first beams circulating and experiments went through significant transformations to increase their detection potential.
Among physics results, the discovery of the odderon by the TOTEM and DØ collaborations, the first laser-cooling of antimatter at ALPHA and first candidate collider neutrinos at FASER are only a few that generated awe at the Laboratory.
CLOUD, BASE, AMS, LHCb, CMS, ATLAS, ALICE, ISOLDE and NA64 also had exciting news in store.

Guardians of the tunnel.
Artificial intelligence technologies are being deployed to inspect and document cracks in CERN’s tunnels in order to assess the risks for the machines inside them
With over 60 km of tunnels and more than 80 caverns at depths ranging from 50 to 175 metres, CERN’s underground infrastructure is one of the most complex in the world.
Most of these tunnels are more than 60 years old, and CERN’s geology of moraines, molasse and limestone requires continuous risk assessment as any movement could disrupt or even halt the operation of the accelerator complex.
During LS2, the Future Studies (FS) section of the Site and Civil Engineering (SCE) department inspected 60 km of underground tunnels and subsurface infrastructure.
They found 550 defects, mostly minor.
However, of the 8% of faults that were severe, cracks were the most common issue.
Traditionally, an engineer would inspect and manually document cracks and other issues in the tunnels, which is a meticulous and slow process.
But a new project being carried out in collaboration with other departments is aimed at finding time-efficient solutions to improve the safety and efficacy of the inspections using new technologies that allow automated analysis, remote inspection and digitalisation.
One of these solutions is the CERN Inspection Tool (TIC – “Collector”), a fully digital, mobile-based app that is fully integrated into CERN’s GIS portal and allows users to record a fault, attach photos, measure distances and locate the fault on a map.
After an inspection, all the records are uploaded wirelessly to the GIS servers, where they can be viewed immediately on the “Tunnel Inspection” thematic map.
But most recently, artificial intelligence devices native to CERN – like the CERNbot and the TIM robot – are being used to acquire data and photos from the tunnels.
These remotely operated robots, developed by the Controls, Electronics and Mechatronics (BE-CEM) group, take inspection photos that are then processed to identify cracks and automatically locate them.
Using photogrammetry and deep learning to analyse CERN's underground infrastructure, a team of experts from the Future Studies section and University College Cork (UCC) has developed a real-time crack and feature recognition algorithm.
“This remote collection of photos and data obtained using robots promises to allow more regular inspections and less risk to inspectors, although further testing is needed”, said John Osborne, Future Studies section leader.
Another PhD research project involving the SCE department and the UCC explores the use of fibre optic cables to remotely measure underground movements, allowing the tunnels to be continuously monitored even during accelerator operation.
CERN Health Insurance Scheme (CHIS) – Monthly contributions as of 1 January 2022.
As the CHIS contribution rates are unchanged for 2022, the CHIS contributions have evolved with the change in the relevant Reference Salary (see Chapter XII of the CHIS Rules).
Thus, as of 1 January 2022, the lump-sum monthly contributions based on Reference Salary II will be as follows:
Lump-sum contributions for voluntary members
The monthly contribution for voluntary members (e.g. users and associates) with the normal health insurance will be 1239 CHF per month, whilst for those with the reduced health insurance it will be 619 CHF.
Lump-sum contributions for post-compulsory members other than CERN pensioners
For post-compulsory members other than CERN pensioners, the monthly contribution will be 1323 CHF in the case of former staff members and former spouses continuing their affiliation, whilst in the case of formerly dependent children continuing theirs it will be 529 CHF.
Michel Spiro promoted to officer of the Legion of Honour.
Michel Spiro was promoted from knight to officer of the Legion of Honour, the French order of merit, on 14 July 2021
Former President of the CERN Council Michel Spiro has been promoted to the class of officer of the Legion of Honour (officier de la Légion d'honneur), the French order of merit.
The announcement of the order’s recipients came in July and Michel Spiro, who is – among other roles – the current president of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) and Chair of the Board of the CERN & Society Foundation, was awarded the honour in a ceremony held at the Collège de France on 30 November 2021 in the presence of his family, colleagues and friends.
Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, the 1997 physics Nobel prize winner, awarded the medal on behalf of the French President in a video transmission.
He underlined Michel Spiro’s important contributions to astro- and particle physics throughout a long international career.
Furthermore, he highlighted his current leadership as President of IUPAP, focusing in particular on his enthusiastic promotion of the International Year of Basic Sciences for Sustainable Development, which was recently proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly.
Michel Spiro concluded with a few words about his commitment to the CERN & Society Foundation and thanked all those who had supported him throughout his career.
The 2021 five-yearly review completes its course.
Formally launched on 1 January 2020, the five-yearly review recently completed its course with the approval by the Council of the proposals put forward by the Management.
This is the culmination of two years of data collection and analysis, consultation with various services across the Organization and in-depth concertation with the Staff Association.
The process is designed to ensure that the Organization remains attractive, with financial and social conditions tailored to allow it to recruit and retain talent from across its Member States.
It also aims to ensure optimal conditions for its fellows, as well as its many associates, in order to guarantee the continued success of the Lab.
As detailed in the Bulletin article on 13 September, the Management’s proposals were elaborated and presented, following concertation with the Staff Association, to TREF, which conveyed its support for the proposals to the Finance Committee, which in turn recommended them to the Council for final approval.
Prior to the presentation to TREF, agreement was reached between the Management and the Staff Association on the proposals regarding maintaining stipends for fellows and subsistence allowances for associated members of the personnel at their current levels.
In parallel, a dedicated technical working group was mandated to review the financial resources for associated members of the personnel employed by an external institute; this work is ongoing.
Agreement was also reached on the proposal regarding Annex A1, which anticipates keeping the five-yearly review exercise open until June 2022 to permit a review of the procedures set out therein, and to allow any necessary technical updates to be made.
The Management and the Staff Association did not, however, reach a common position on the proposal regarding staff salaries.
While the Staff Association argued for a 9% increase in salaries, the Management maintained that the data did not support this: this proposal was therefore submitted to the Director-General for arbitration.
In the light of the data from salary surveys performed by the ISRP (OECD) and CERN’s recruitment and retention report, which confirmed the Organization’s continued ability to attract and retain candidates from all its Member States, while acknowledging persistent challenges for some, the Director-General decided to uphold the Management’s proposal to maintain salaries at their current levels.
More information indicating that the difficulties arise not from salaries, but rather from the wider perspective of family-related criteria, dual careers, the contract policy and myriad other reasons affecting the decision to take up a position abroad can be found here.
In this vein, the benchmarking study on matters related to diversity and inclusion, which the ISRP (OECD) was mandated in 2020 to carry out in the course of this five-yearly review exercise, provides rich and important data.
The Management, in collaboration with the Staff Association, is fully committed to following up on the results to ensure that diversity and inclusion matters are not limited to actions being taken once every five years, but are under continuous review.
In December, the Finance Committee unanimously recommended and the Council unanimously approved the Management’s proposals.
Nevertheless, this study highlighted the need for continued efforts to increase recruitment from underrepresented Member States, in line with the Director-General’s strategic objectives.
Hiring a diverse, representative workforce is key to CERN’s continued success; to that end, dedicated efforts are under way to ensure that we attract a diverse talent pool, with due commitment to the international character of the Organization.
The Graduate Programme Review, currently under development, will also play an important role in attracting bright graduates to CERN by ensuring competitive employment conditions, and this in turn will help create a diverse pipeline for our staff contingent of the future.
Further, the launch this year of the Diversity and Inclusion programme’s 25 by ’25 strategy, which is the first ever target-based strategy to boost gender and nationality diversity within the staff and fellows population, is timely and will foster a culture of awareness throughout the Organization and a proactive approach to achieving the objectives collectively.
CERN is a unique organisation, and the rich discussions that have taken place and concerns that have been raised throughout this five-yearly review process underline our common goal of fostering its international and vibrant community so that we can continue to deliver on our mission: science for the benefit of all.

Winners of 2019 EU Contest for Young Scientists visit CERN.
The young scientists earned the week-long discovery visit of CERN after designing and prototyping a High-Altitude Micro Air Vehicle
In November 2021, CERN hosted the laureates of the 31st EU Contest for Young Scientists (EUCYS) – the biggest science fair for young students in the European Union – for a visit of its facilities and experiments.
The contest, funded under Horizon 2020, aims to attract young people to a career in science and research.
The 2019 winners, a team of three Polish students based in the Netherlands, designed a drone that could return from the lower layers of the stratosphere with a scientific payload to the launch location and were rewarded with a week-long visit of CERN for their efforts.
Unfortunately, due to restrictions related to the pandemic, CERN has had to postpone the visit, initially planned for 2020, to 2021.
Two of the winners, Lukasz and Mateusz, could eventually make it to CERN, where they visited the laboratory’s many facilities and experiments, from CERN’s Synchrocyclotron to ATLAS, and IdeaSquare.
As part of their visit, they were invited to print metal objects on the Organization’s metal 3D-printers.
Mateusz designed a piece inspired by cave paintings left behind by early humans while Lukasz created a replica of an octupole magnet inspired by their visit to the Antiproton Decelerator.
Lukasz and Mateusz expressed their deep gratitude for an experience which they said strengthened their resolve to continue their academic studies.
They voiced interest in applying for student internships at CERN to further explore the many facets of engineering.
Computer Security: Disaster for your crown jewels.
Following one of our previous articles on ransomware (“The risk of losing it all…”) and the three mantras to counter it – don’t get it; don’t pay; have disaster-recovery means in place – let’s discuss that third mantra again.
How to avoid a disaster for your “crown jewels”.
Crown jewels?
Of course, here we don’t mean the shiny carbon pellets belonging to the Queen of the United Kingdom and stored in the Tower of London but rather documents, files, settings and other data whose unrecoverable loss would signify a tremendous trauma for you and a significant setback for the Organization.
A real disaster.  Like you losing all your precious family photos from the day you and your kids were born.
Some CERN examples might be:
calibration data of accelerator or experiment components that took months of cosmic runs, low-intensity runs or other special runs to acquire or whose values have been fine-tuned over years of operation – think of cryogenics systems, the beam loss monitors, silicon trackers and calorimeters; calibration data, fudge factors, efficiencies, run information and similar values gained after iterations of reprocessing of physics data, accumulated knowledge of detector performance, zillions of cross-checks, and essential data for the correct interpretation thereof; physics analysis software – online or offline – leading to major discoveries; all the data necessary to perform a cold restart of your control system or computing service, or to reinstall it from scratch without the process taking more than a few days; configuration data essential for running computing services like the Active Directory, the collection of Puppet manifests or the EOS file catalogue; records of historical value like photos or our funding documents; Pension Fund records and investment plans; contracts, NDAs and other documents signed by and committing the Organization.
Ideally and theoretically, all that data (and any other crown jewels you know of and hold dear) should be placed in the safe custody of the IT department with multiple and independently stored copies in place, tested for recovery and well protected against alteration.
But given the complexity and heterogeneity of the Organization, it’s better to be safe than sorry and to double-check.
Do you own any of the aforementioned or any other crown jewels?
Where do you store them?
Do the storage owners and storage managers know about them?
Have they put the right means in place to really guarantee fully independent, unalterable and verified back-ups?
Are you sure that your expectations of back-ups, business continuity and disaster recovery match what they offer?
Tell us by email at
Remember that there are three kinds of people: (1) those who don't back up (and regret it later), (2) those who back up but don't check their back-ups (and definitely regret it later), and (3) those who back up and check their back-ups.
It’s not too late to check!
You, as a CERN service manager, data taker, control system expert, trigger master, software custodian or document librarian, have a professional responsibility to ensure that your crown jewels are properly protected and backed up.
So, talk to us or your storage provider.  Figure out how your mission-critical information assets are handled.
And make disaster recovery a priority.  Otherwise, you risk losing it all… which would be a disaster for your crown jewels, and for CERN.

CERN and IUPAP: A long-standing partnership.
The International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) gets ready to mark its centenary year in 2022 and, as a long-standing partner, CERN will be part of the celebrations
IUPAP is the only global international scientific union dedicated to physics, connecting physicists from all fields and all continents.
Founded in Brussels in 1922 with 13 member countries, its membership has grown today to 60 countries.
Its centenary will be marked by a series of activities celebrating physics and marking the Union’s achievements.
These include a Centennial Symposium to be held at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste in July as a hybrid event.
Events will also be organised in 2023, including the 100th anniversary of the first IUPAP General Assembly, which will be held at the newly inaugurated CERN Science Gateway, if the situation allows.
IUPAP and CERN have a long history of collaboration.  As early as 1958, CERN hosted the IUPAP-sponsored meeting “The 8th Annual International Conference on High-Energy Physics”.
Since then, CERN scientists have played active roles in many IUPAP commissions and working groups, in particular Commission 11: “Particles and Fields” and Working Group 1: “International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA)”.
IUPAP continues to develop and to expand its global reach.
To ensure stability and continuity in its operations, IUPAP has taken the decision to register itself in Geneva as an association under Swiss law.
It has also introduced corporate associate membership, which will enable new actors to get involved, including industry with a focus on physics.
A new configuration for a new century.
IUPAP was the driving force behind last week’s UN General Assembly proclamation of 2022 as the International Year of Basic Science for Sustainable Development, giving CERN another good reason to pursue the partnership as the Union enters its second century.
Innovation in managing excavated materials: an FCC contribution to the circular economy.
First phase of CERN’s “Mining the Future” competition successfully completed
A key recommendation of last year’s update to the European Strategy for Particle Physics is that Europe, in collaboration with the worldwide community, should undertake a feasibility study for a next-generation hadron collider.
As a result, the Future Circular Collider (FCC) Feasibility Study is committed to investigating the technical and financial viability of such a facility at CERN.
The feasibility study for the FCC provides a unique space to explore ideas that could tackle the colossal challenge of achieving a more sustainable future and to test technologies with applications beyond particle physics.
To that end, CERN and the Montanuniversität Leoben in Austria launched the international competition Mining the Future with the support of the EU-funded Horizon 2020 FCC Innovation Study project.
In line with circular economy principles, the challenge set for the participants was to identify credible solutions for the innovative reuse and sustainable management of the large quantities of molasse material that would be excavated during the construction phase of the future FCC tunnel.
Such rock deposits are abundant in the Geneva region and all over the Alps.
“The solutions put forward for the construction of new underground tunnels to host future colliders could also apply to other future tunnel and underground civil engineering projects.
CERN has a long-standing record of pioneering technical solutions that are put to good use in areas lying beyond its core scientific mission,” said CERN’s Johannes Gutleber.
Phase 1 of Mining the Future ran from 1 May to 31 October.
Applicants from all over Europe stepped up to tackle this challenge, submitting high-quality proposals with huge innovation potential.
Young researchers, fresh start-ups, universities and traditional players from the construction industry formed consortia to develop their strategies.
Each of the proposals addresses both the technical feasibility – with participants presenting evidence from a controlled laboratory environment – and the socio-economic impact.
Some of the solutions focus on developing fast and efficient sorting processes enabling the reuse of the excavated material for the creation of marketable products.
These products can then cover regional needs or feed the European marketplace – participants went as far as providing the tools for connecting supply with demand.
Other innovative proposals are dedicated to the elaboration of methods for transforming the excavated molasse into construction materials or alternatively, proposing smart construction techniques based on the immediate reuse of molasse.
By keeping excavated materials in play, circular economy models offer a clear pathway towards achieving our collective climate goals and reducing greenhouse gas emissions linked to the extraction, processing, manufacturing and landfilling of natural resources.  “Tunnel excavation material is, too often, still treated as waste.
Change needs to come in the form of both new technical solutions and an updated legal framework.
Everyone can benefit from a green underground infrastructure,” said Professor Robert Galler, co-organiser of the competition and chair of the jury committee.
Over the coming months, the jury committee will carefully evaluate the applications.
This second stage of this contest will offer participants the opportunity to refine their proposals.
The final winner will be announced in August 2022, with an award ceremony to take place next October at ZaB-Zentrum am Berg, Austria.
On the long path towards the FCC, the Mining the Future competition is a resolute first step towards the development of new construction models that create economic value, build local resilience and spur innovation across sectors.
New CERN safety rule for cables.
The CERN Safety Rules listed below have been published on the CERN website dedicated to the Safety Rules : specific Safety Instruction SSI-FS-2-1 “Fire Safety and Radiation Resistance requirements for Cables”.
This Specific Safety Instructions cancels and replaces Safety Instruction IS 23.
The SSI-FS-2-1 defines the minimum Safety requirements with respect to fire performance and resistance to ionising radiation of insulation and sheathing materials of cables used in CERN installations.
It applies to cables purchased by or on behalf of CERN or otherwise brought onto the CERN site as from the date of its entry into force. Cables that are part of CE marked equipment are not subject to this Specific Safety Instruction.
The SSI-FS-2-1 is complemented by Safety Guideline SG-FS-2-1-1 which provides guidance as to the implementation of SSI-FS-2-1 in particular with regard to the certification and selection of Cable materials.
The fire performance requirements set out in the SSI-FS-2-1 refer to the European Construction Products Regulation (CPR) and are thus aligned with common industrial standards and certification processes. This will facilitate the procurement of cables.
 The new rule allows for flexibility with regards to specific types of cables and in-kind contributions.
Tailored procedures based on risk assessments strike a balance between CERNs functional needs and the level of Safety required.
The CERN Safety Rules apply to all persons under the Director-General’s authority.  They are available under the following link:
Celebrating the role of basic science in sustainable development.
Last week, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed 2022 the International Year of Basic Sciences for Sustainable Development (IYBSSD).
An initiative championed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), which celebrates its 100th anniversary next year, the international year will be organised under the auspices of UNESCO.
If COVID-19 has taught us anything, it is the importance and impact of fundamental research.
It is therefore timely that 2022 should highlight the role of basic science in support of sustainable development.
Promoted by IUPAP, under the energetic leadership of former CERN Council President Michel Spiro, IYBSSD is an opportunity for us to raise awareness of the practical benefits that our research brings.
It is expected that IYBSSD will be kicked off with an opening conference at UNESCO in Paris in July 2022, and conclude with a closing ceremony at CERN one year later.
Its focus will be the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and how understanding nature at a fundamental level not only helps to make the Agenda’s goals achievable, but also promotes sustainable policy making for the common good and technology development that can advance the implementation of the agenda.
CERN, along with 26 other scientific organisations, supported IUPAP’s initiative, and we are looking forward to being part of a rich year of activities showcasing the value of basic science for society.
CERN has a strong story to tell.
Since the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals by the full membership of the United Nations in 2015, we have been working actively, often in partnership with other organisations, to find ways to enable expertise and know-how from particle physics to support the Agenda.
Among the most recent examples: this year’s Webfest brought together young talent from across the world to promote the Goals; the new Technology Impact Fund provides a platform for bridging the gap between the technology developed for research at CERN and its potential applications to address societal challenges; and CERN’s COVID Airborne Risk Assessment (CARA) tool has led to the Organization working with the WHO to develop a standardised algorithm to quantify airborne COVID-19 transmission risk in indoor settings.
CERN’s engagement with sustainable development, however, is not new.
The Organization has always striven to make its technologies and expertise available to society as a whole.
Our work on medical imaging, dating back to the 1970s, is a good example, while CERN’s collaboration with the United Nations satellite centre, UNOSAT, celebrated its 20th anniversary this year.
Ongoing activities for medical applications, educational programmes and capacity-building initiatives for countries with developing particle physics communities all contribute to advancing sustainable development through the channel of basic research.
Many are the subject of active Knowledge Transfer initiatives, while CERN’s Environment Reports, the second of which was published this year, also highlight CERN technologies with the potential to promote environmental sustainability.
We look forward to an exciting year celebrating the value of basic sciences for the global common good and the future of our world, and hope that many of you will join the celebrations.
Environmental awareness: Managing chemical products.
Chemical safety at CERN begins with avoiding chemical products whenever possible.
If that is not an option, the least hazardous chemical product should be selected.
Wherever chemical products are used, appropriate prevention measures should be observed.
In addition to these measures, CERN provides training courses and has put in place procedures regarding chemical safety.
CERN experts are available to support you in identifying and evaluating chemical products and to provide advice on their appropriate usage (e.g. handling and storage) and alternative products.
For further questions, please _____________________

CERN receives a local “soft mobility” prize.
The Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, through the Ain Energy and Climate Agency, has awarded its ecomobility prize to CERN as a “soft-mobility accelerator”.
The French local authorities have recognised CERN’s ecomobility actions by awarding it the “establishments committed to soft mobility” prize, following the regional “Mobility Challenge” that was taken up by the CERN community in September 2021.
The Ain Energy and Climate Agency (Agence de l’énergie et du climat de l’Ain – ALEC 01) singled out CERN as one of the department’s employers that are successfully investing in alternatives to the private car.
Gilles Bollinger (SCE-SCC-CS), a member of CERN’s Soft Mobility Working Group, accepted the prize on the Organization’s behalf at a ceremony held in Miribel near Lyon on 30 November.
During the ceremony, Gilles had the opportunity to present CERN’s “soft mobility” strategy, which is geared towards increasing the facilities available to cyclists (cycle paths, bicycle stands, bicycle maintenance equipment) and renting out bicycles and electric bicycles through the Mobility Service.
He also underlined CERN’s commitment to initiatives like the annual “Bike2Work” campaign and the Mobility Challenge.
The strategy is bearing fruit.  In 2018, 32% of the CERN community commuted to work by bicycle, on foot or using public transport.
This figure, which is above the average for conurbations, earned CERN the title of “soft-mobility accelerator” from the organisers of the prize.
Burglary season begins – stay alert.
Although break-ins are on the decline in the canton of Geneva, the winter season brings with it an increased risk of burglary.
When the days get shorter, burglars are more likely to notice if houses or flats are unoccupied.
Consequently, so-called “twilight burglaries” soar.
To assist the population in the fight against this type of crime, the Swiss police have launched a nationwide campaign to raise awareness of the risks of burglary and of appropriate preventive measures.
The risk of burglary can be considerably reduced by taking some simple preventive steps:
Simulate someone being at home by putting lights on a timer or programming your TV/radio.
Call 117 immediately if you notice any suspicious behaviour, including at your neighbours’.
Lock your doors, even if you are away for a short time.
Inform your neighbours if you are away for an extended period.

Access to the Organization’s site during the 2021 end-of-year closure.
This year, CERN will be closed from Wednesday, 22 December 2021 to Tuesday, 4 January 2022 inclusive.
The first working day of the new year will be Wednesday, 5 January 2022.
As is the case every year, the only persons who will be entitled to enter the CERN site during the end-of-year closure are those who have been authorised to do so for strictly professional reasons (stand-by service or indispensable maintenance work).
The COVID-19-related restrictions remain applicable.
A specific e-group records all such authorised personnel.
Managers (department heads, group leaders, contract supervisors, etc.) and experiments’ technical coordinators are responsible for submitting the names of the persons concerned to their department’s designated person for updating the e-group by Tuesday, 21 December 2021.
The procedure is documented on the service portal.
Unlike in previous years, it is no longer necessary to include members of the personnel of outside companies in these departmental/experiment lists.
Any members of the personnel of outside companies who are required to work on the CERN site during the closure must have a valid notice of work to be done outside normal working hours (AET).
Please note that AETs must be limited to the time needed to perform the work in question or, in the case of annual AETs, must not extend beyond 21/12/2022.
As a reminder, all 2021 AETs will end on 17/12/2021 at the latest.
During the period when the Laboratory is closed, from 22 December onwards, any members of the CERN personnel who need to enter the CERN site for an urgent reason and without prior authorisation from their department or their experiment’s technical coordinator will be obliged to submit an access request ("CERNXMAS" permission request), which may be signed by the Security service or the CCC (TI) after its legitimacy has been assessed.
The “CERNXMAS” permission option will not be available in the ADAMS system until 22 December.
This provision does not apply to members of the personnel of outside companies, since they must have a valid AET.
We would also like to remind you that all CERN services, including the restaurants and the library, will be closed during the end-of-year closure.
We thank you for your cooperation and wish you all a very happy holiday.
CMS homes in on Higgs boson’s lifetime.
The collaboration reports a value for the Higgs boson’s lifetime that has a small enough uncertainty to confirm that the particle has a tiny lifetime
The Higgs boson doesn’t stick around for long.
Once it is created in particle collisions, the famed particle lives for a mere less than a trillionth of a billionth of a second or, more precisely, 1.6 x 10-22 seconds.
According to theory, that is, for so far experiments have only been able to set bounds on the value of the particle’s lifetime or to determine this property with a large uncertainty.
Until now.
In a new study, the CMS collaboration reports a value for the particle’s lifetime that has a small enough uncertainty to confirm that the Higgs boson does have such a short lifetime.
Measuring the Higgs boson’s lifetime is high on the wish list of particle physicists, because an experimental value of the lifetime would allow them not only to better understand the nature of the particle but also to find out whether or not the value matches the value predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics.
A deviation from the prediction could point to new particles or forces not predicted by the Model, including new particles into which the Higgs boson would decay.
But it isn’t easy to measure the Higgs boson’s lifetime.
For one, the predicted lifetime is too short to be measured directly.
A possible solution entails measuring a related property called the mass width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime and represents the small range of possible masses around the particle’s nominal mass of 125 GeV.
But this isn’t easy either, as the predicted mass width of the Higgs boson is too small to be easily measured by experiments.
Quantum physics to the rescue.
In addition to being produced with a mass equal or close to its nominal value, a short-lived particle such as the Higgs boson can also be produced with a much larger mass than the nominal value, although the odds of this happening are lower.
This effect – and in fact the mass width of the particle as well – is a manifestation of a quantum quirk known as Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, and a comparison between the production rate of these large-mass, or “off-shell”, Higgs bosons with that of the nominal or close to nominal, or “on-shell”, Higgs bosons can be used to extract the Higgs boson’s mass width and therefore its lifetime.
This is the method employed by the CMS team in their new study.
By analysing data collected by the CMS experiment during the second run of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), specifically data on Higgs bosons transforming into two Z bosons, which themselves transform into four charged leptons or two charged leptons plus two neutrinos, the CMS researchers have obtained the first-ever evidence for the production of off-shell Higgs bosons.
From this result, which has only a 1 in 1000 chance of being a statistical fluke, the CMS team obtained a Higgs boson’s lifetime of 2.1 x 10-22 seconds, with an upper/lower uncertainty of (+2.3/-0.9) x 10-22 seconds.
This value, the most precise yet, aligns well with the Standard Model prediction and confirms that the particle does indeed have a tiny lifespan.
“Our result demonstrates that off-shell Higgs-boson production offers an excellent way to measure the Higgs boson’s lifetime,” says CMS physicist Pascal Vanlaer.
“And it sets a milestone in the study of the properties of this unique particle.
The precision of the measurement is expected to improve in the coming years with data from the next LHC runs and new analysis ideas.”

Become an ambassador for the Women and Girls in Science and Technology event.
For the week of 7 to 11 February 2022, female scientists and engineers are invited to speak at local schools to get young people excited about science.
You can volunteer to take part!
CERN, the University of Geneva’s Scienscope and EPFL will be joining forces in 2022, for the sixth year running, to celebrate the International Day of Women and Girls in Science.
This year they will be joined for the first time by the Annecy Particle Physics Laboratory (LAPP).
From 7 to 11 February 2022, female scientists and engineers will visit local schools to talk to the students about their professions.
These science ambassadors will talk about their career history, offer an insight into the projects and experiments in which they are involved, and maybe even give a short demonstration.
The aim is to change how young people view scientific, technical and technological professions and to show that they are just as accessible to girls as to boys.
And, who knows, the presentations might even help some to discover their vocation!
The Women and Girls in Science and Technology week is a huge success every year.
Even in 2021, the hybrid set-up did not deter the schools or the presenters, with more than 20 presentations given in the classroom and another fifty or so via videoconference!
This is why we are always looking for more volunteer female scientists willing to give up a bit of their time to visit schools.
So come and join the adventure by signing up: the deadline is 5 January 2022 (11.59 p.m.).
Conditions of participation:
Registration is open to all women working in a profession connected with science, technology, engineering or maths (STEM), as well as computer science, communication or education.  Priority will be given to presenters from CERN, the University of Geneva, EPFL and LAPP.
If you are not from one of these institutions but would like to take part, contact us.  Deliver one-hour presentations for a maximum of 30 pupils aged 7 to 15.  The majority of presentations will be given in French (95%), but English speakers can also sign up.  You will be required to attend a briefing session.  People classified as vulnerable and subject to COVID-19 protection measures may not sign up.
COVID-19 measures: We are closely monitoring the evolving health situation and the related measures in place at CERN, in Switzerland and in France.
Please note that this event will take place via videoconference only if the situation in February rules out in-person events.

Computer Security: A new bonbon to protect you.
With the new firewall in place (“Block the bad, grant the good access”) in addition to our dedicated malware-quarantining appliance that has been running smoothly for some years, it’s time for strike number three: the deployment of new anti-virus, anti-malware and endpoint detection and response software running on Windows and Mac computers.
Our bonbon for Christmas.
Multi-featured anti-malware software (AM) and sophisticated endpoint detection and response software (EDR) are the last line of defence for your computer before everything goes down the drain (“What have accelerators and pipelines in common?”).
By monitoring local activities on your computer – by the operating system, on the local file system and network communications – the AM and EDR are jointly able to detect and report abnormal or malicious activity.
The AM is a security suite constituting the first line of defence.
It looks for malware signatures identified by a global threat intelligence network as well as improves system security generally by, for example, detecting behaviour associated with ransomware, blocking access to malicious websites and monitoring that system updates have been applied.
The EDR is a specialised threat hunting and response software using CERN-internal and external threat intelligence feeds to detect more sophisticated attacks.
Whole system state behaviour is analysed by the central dashboard, allowing CERN’s Security Operations Centre to analyse threats in real time in order to better understand the origin, damage, extent and consequences of the successful attack, as well as run remote queries intended for threat hunting.
CERN is about to purchase this new AM and EDR solution and is in the process of rolling it out.
Based on different use cases, device ownerships, responsibilities and privacy aspects, there are two distinct deployment methods for CERN-owned devices and for personal devices (“bring your own device” or, for short, BYOD):
All centrally managed devices, i.e. centrally managed Windows servers and centrally managed Windows PCs/laptops, will have AM, EDR solutions deployed via the standard means (i.e. CMF) and remotely managed, monitored and maintained by CERN Desktop Support.
Similarly, the installation of AM and EDR solutions are envisaged and supposed to be deployed and enforced for all Windows laptops and Macbooks bought with a CERN budget code.
In all cases, the CERN Computer Security team will intervene and conduct remote incident response in case the AM/EDR triggers an alert; 
When it comes to BYOD, your personal Windows laptops, Macbooks and the PCs you use at home for teleworking also benefit!
You can download and install the AM free of charge from the CERN app store for Windows or Mac-Self Service.
The licence must be renewed every 12 months by reconnecting to that app store or it will become invalid.
However, since the installation concerns your personal device, your privacy is paramount to us.  All alerts will be displayed only to the local user.
Neither the CERN Service Desk nor the Windows Support Team nor the CERN Computer Security Team will be able to remotely connect to your device.
You would need to contact us at case of problems or issues.
Thus, with this new AM and EDR offer by CERN, you can protect your work horse, your teleworking posts, your personal data and CERN, all in one go.
Right in time for Christmas.
C’est bon-bon, non?  Do you want to learn more about computer security incidents and issues at CERN?

Adrenaline rush at LHC Point 5.
CERN’s most ambitious emergency response exercise to date took place on 13 November at LHC Point 5, with the involvement of French, Swiss and CERNois safety and rescue teams
It is a peaceful Saturday morning in Cessy, France.
Thick autumn clouds conceal the slopes of the Jura and, close to the sleepy village, the CMS experiment at the LHC gets ready for the coming accelerator run.
But deep within the vast experiment complex, an incident interrupts the quiet: a careless technician, bypassing every safety system, mishandles gas, which catches fire.
From this point on, all hell breaks loose.
The gas spreading to the underground cavern explodes, injuring workers and visitors and causing scaffolding to collapse on one of the underground evacuation paths.
Fried by the subsequent power surge, a crane engine crashes, immobilising the machine and its operator, stuck dozens of metres above ground.
The nearby High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) worksite and caverns are not spared: kindled by the power surge, fire engulfs a break room and, further down the site, a mechanic gets trapped under heavy metal beams.
Oh, and an electrician gets shocked and injured while trying to solve a technical problem in a surface building, too.
Sound plausible?
“To play an exercise of this scale, we needed to come up with likely scenarios after a very, very unlikely trigger.
We are already well prepared for the bad, but what of the worst of the worst?”, explains Roberto Perruzza, LEXGLIMOS (group leader in matters of safety) at CMS who, along with Marc Nas, deputy group leader of the CERN Fire and Rescue Service, designed and controlled this large-scale, realistic emergency response exercise.
The complexity of the exercise’s scenario, outlined above, was mirrored by the number and variety of teams involved.
Supported by 90 CERN volunteers, who helped with coordination and safety and played the role of technicians, visitors and casualties, the main stars of the morning were seven safety and rescue teams hailing from one international organisation (the CERN Fire and Rescue Service) and two countries (the French and Swiss fire brigades and civil protection forces, plus the Brigade Sanitaire Cantonale and the Swiss Samaritains rescue association, with their Piquet Catastrophe group).
The exercise was designed following the success of a similar exercise at the Globe in 2019, to enhance interoperability and communication between the teams and to improve knowledge and understanding of their respective working methods when implementing a multinational response to a major incident in a complex infrastructure at CERN.
For almost four hours, the 260 participants wreaked a perfectly orchestrated and executed havoc at Point 5, on the surface and in the CMS and HL-LHC caverns.
The rescue teams had to deal with a very fake fire made of posters depicting flames, very real scaffolding set up in the CMS service cavern to impede the response, and casualties screaming in skilfully feigned pain.
This allowed them to test the efficiency of the doctrine équipes mixtes, a common multinational response plan that anticipates interventions of a country’s rescue teams on the other country’s territory, as well as handover of command between teams in times of need – all of this under the framework of the tripartite agreement binding CERN, France and Switzerland for matters of emergency response.
“We will identify and work on the lessons to be learned from the exercise in the coming weeks.
But the main takeaway was clear from the minute we were done: we need to do it again, and more frequently, on a smaller scale!
The relationships we build during these exercises will be crucial in the event of a real emergency response, as is the knowledge of the other teams’ methods we gain in the process,” says Marc Nas.  “Besides, it is a pleasure to work alongside people who are determined to power through a complex project and eager to make a success out of it.
All the participants were very satisfied with the outcome and we look forward to repeating the exercise in the future.”

CERN releases its second Environment Report setting out concrete actions to reduce its environmental footprint.
The report covers the years 2019-2020 when the accelerator complex was in its second long shutdown, an opportunity for CERN to improve its environmental footprint on several levels
CERN released its second public Environment Report today.
The report covers the years 2019-2020 when the accelerator complex was in its second long shutdown.
The Organization took the opportunity of this maintenance and upgrade period to improve its environmental footprint on several levels: for example, by limiting CERN’s direct greenhouse gas emissions and by working on local heat recovery projects.
In addition, a major objective of the long shutdown was to prepare the ground for the high-luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), which is being done with environmental considerations firmly in mind.
To ensure transparency and to demonstrate its leadership in environmental management for research organisations, the Laboratory made a commitment in 2019 to communicate on its environmental footprint every two years and in alignment with the internationally recognised GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards.
“The production of CERN’s first public Environment Report in 2020 enabled us to establish reporting frameworks and set concrete goals.
This second report is about turning words into action,” declares CERN Director-General, Fabiola Gianotti.
To limit CERN’s direct greenhouse gas emissions, mostly related to the use of various fluorinated gases (F-gases), the experiments launched a leak repair campaign to decrease F-gas emissions.
The second long shutdown also marked the first step towards replacing F-gases with carbon dioxide (CO2) in detector cooling systems.
CO2 has a substantially lower global warming potential than F-gases.
This effort contributes to last year’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gases by 28% by the end of 2024.
CERN is also working on various heat recovery projects.
In 2019, the Organization signed an agreement with the local French authorities regarding the collection of heat from its facilities at Point 8 of the Large Hadron Collider to provide heating for a residential area in neighbouring Ferney-Voltaire.
Houses will be heated with reduced CO2 emissions and at a lower cost.
The quantity of heat delivered will be progressive over 8-10 years, ultimately reaching 20 GWh/year.
A plan to test the functionality of the system is scheduled for the end of 2022.
CERN is continuing to explore heat recovery on the Meyrin and Prévessin sites.
The Environment Report also describes the energy efficiency improvements implemented at the HL-LHC, in particular its ability to gather more data per unit of energy used.
Over the 20-year life-span of the upgraded machine, energy efficiency will eventually rise to a factor of ten higher than when CERN’s flagship facility was originally switched on.
In addition to direct greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1) and indirect greenhouse gas emissions related to electricity consumption (scope 2), this year’s report presents for the first time data related to other indirect emissions (scope 3), including business travel, personnel commutes and catering.  A procedure for evaluating procurement-related emissions and a project for greening CERN’s procurement are under preparation and will be covered in a future report.
“CERN is reporting on its scope 3 emissions for the first time, marking an important step in understanding and controlling the environmental impact beyond CERN’s walls, upstream and downstream in our supply chain,” says Benoît Delille, head of the Occupational Health and Safety and Environmental protection unit at CERN.

Give the gift of security to communities at risk of natural disasters all over the world.
Powerful and unexpected natural events such as earthquakes and tsunamis can erase entire communities in seconds.
In a world plagued by inequality, regions at risk are not always the best prepared to protect their populations from disaster.
To help them face such calamities, CERN is developing the Compact Precision Laser Inclinometer (CPLI), an extremely sophisticated early-warning system for seismic events that will completely change civil protection strategies to protect communities and reduce direct losses.
A gift to the CERN & Society Foundation in this festive season is a gesture that could save a life from the destruction of earthquakes.
You can donate now on the Foundation’s website.
Further development of the CPLI technology is currently limited by a lack of funds.
With external support from donors, the CPLI technology will:
• be improved in terms of reliability and availability, allowing wider deployment, at a reasonable cost, in remote and underdeveloped areas; CERN is committed to making the technology available worldwide to help all communities in need;
• be paired with increased processing power and software, which will allow online measurements and data processing with artificial intelligence techniques, a vital tool for early-alert systems.
The Compact Precision Laser Inclinometer is the first technology selected under the CERN Technology Impact Fund, a new framework to support CERN technologies with strong potential to address existing global societal issues as identified by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).

(Postponed) Unconventional Music @ CERN: Celebrating 100 years of Albert Einstein's Nobel Prize.
To celebrate Einstein’s love of music and science, the Swedish Embassy in Switzerland and CERN have organised the virtual event Unconventional Music @ CERN on the Nobel Week
The Globe of Science and Innovation at CERN will host an online event including a concert with unconventional instruments (one theremin and a noise table) in musical conversation with top CERN scientists on Wednesday 8 December 2021 to celebrate the anniversary of Albert Einstein’s Nobel Prize.
Albert Einstein was awarded a Nobel Prize in December 1921, to honour his contributions to theoretical physics and his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.
Because of his innumerable contributions to science, Einstein is considered the father of modern physics, but he was also an accomplished violinist who loved music.
“If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician.
I often think in music.
I live my daydreams in music.
I see my life in terms of music...
I get most joy in life out of music.” - Albert Einstein
At the time Einstein received the Nobel Prize, a Russian engineer, Lev Termen, was laying the foundations of modern electronic music with his invention, the theremin.
It was a technically advanced instrument relying on the progress in the scientific field at the time.
Curious of this instrument, Einstein attended various concerts and even tried to play it.
Einstein and Nobel are two great minds whose legacies are as important today as ever.
Albert Einstein had a strong connection to Switzerland.
He studied in Aarau and Zürich, then researched in Bern before becoming a teacher at ETH in Zürich.
CERN and the Swedish Embassy found that unconventional music performed by a Swiss (Roland Bucher) and a Swedish (Henrik Rylander) artist in conversation with CERN scientists and musicians is an excellent way to celebrate Albert Einstein’s Nobel Prize anniversary.
Talks about Einstein, music and physics given by Prof. Brian Foster (University of Oxford) and Dr. Piotr Traczyk (CERN) will be followed by music performances of invited artists and CERN scientists and musicians: Pippa Wells, Paula Collins, Chiara Mariotti and Angela Ricci.
Join the live webcast from CERN's Globe of Science and Innovation on Wednesday 8 December at 1.30 p.m. and celebrate science with us.

New building for the Prévessin site.
The new Building 937 in Prévessin, inaugurated on 10 November, becomes an additional centre of the BE-CEM group’s activities
The quiet revolution unfolding at CERN’s Prévessin site is paving the way for infrastructure, environmental and public engagement projects for various departments.  Among them is the Beams department (BE), whose new building is bringing all the activities of the Controls, Electronics and Mechatronics (BE-CEM) group onto the same site.
Two sections of the BE-CEM group – the Mechatronics, Robotics and Operation (CEM-MRO) and Electronics Production and Radiation Tolerance (CEM-EPR) sections – are of particular interest.
Building 937 (B937), inaugurated on 10 November, brings under the same roof the lab facilities for robotics, mechatronics and electronics testing, cable manufacturing and radiation testing, along with offices for the two sections.
The building’s open-plan layout facilitates the work and discussions of both staff members and students.
B937 brings added operational value for the long-term activities of BE-CEM, notably by providing the MRO section with a proper infrastructure for robotics manufacturing, testing, accessibility and transport in the field.  “What is important from an operational point of view is the entry and exit of robots in an easy way through the dedicated entrance in the lab,” explains Mario Di Castro, MRO section leader.
“This was not possible in the previous laboratory, where there were accessibility constraints that could slow down any intervention in the event of emergencies.”
The BE-CEM group provides all CERN accelerators and experimental areas with robots ranging from off-the-shelf robots to large robots on wheels, such as the CERNbot robotic arm and TIM.
Preparations of new robotic missions in the context of the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) project, such as the installation of vacuum assembly for experimental area (VAX) modules near high-radiation experimental areas at CMS and ATLAS, the robotic machining of the ATLAS shielding and the remote maintenance of LHC collimators, will take place in the new building.
B937 is located close to Building 927, which hosts an LHC mock-up that is used for robotics activities, making for better synergy between the conception, testing and training of robots.
The new building is of great value not just for the robotics lab, but also for the other facilities of the CEM-MRO and CEM-EPR sections.
The BE-CEM group also provides “controls hardware and low level software design, controls infrastructure support and mechatronics for the LHC collimators and beam intercepting devices in the accelerator complex, the transfer lines and the experimental areas; and supports all CERN groups and sectors with electronics production and radiation tolerance testing as well as providing turnkey test and measurement solutions,” emphasises Alessandro Masi, BE-CEM group leader.
With all five sections of the BE-CEM group now in Prévessin (B937, B864 and B774), collaboration and workflow will be facilitated within the group, but also within and with other departments.
The B937 project, which included an in-depth strategic review of functional user requirements, was executed swiftly thanks to the close collaboration between the Site and Civil Engineering (SCE) department, project leader Luigi Serio and an external contractor that took on full responsibility for the fulfilment of the project’s requirements.
B937 was designed according to the latest construction standards.
It is compact in order to increase its overall efficiency and achieve a low energy consumption through features such as a circulating air unit to limit the use of air conditioning and luminosity detectors to prevent the use of unnecessary artificial lighting.  “For projects similar to this one, where requirements can be established upfront, where you prepare a project management framework or methodology and you follow it correctly, it is the most effective, efficient and economical way to implement the infrastructure,” declares the project leader for the building’s construction, Luigi Serio.
By looking at the full life cycle of similar initiatives, from construction to operation, maintenance and long-term impact on the Organization’s activities, returns from experience can guide future decisions on infrastructure projects at CERN.
This article is a part of the series “A quiet revolution is under way at Prévessin”.
Stay safe and keep on pedalling.
Good practices and rules for cycling at CERN and in the Host States
Cycling to work is good for your health and the environment.
Commuting to CERN by bike has been on the rise over the past years.
As we enter the darker and colder months of the year, it is important to adapt and take additional precautionary measures when hitting the road.
Did you know that, in France, wearing a safety vest is mandatory when cycling at night and when visibility is poor (due to fog, for example) outside urban areas?
Wherever you live, as a cyclist, it is essential to be visible at all times by wearing high-visibility clothing and fitting out your bike with lights and reflectors.
Whatever the season, it is strongly recommended to wear a helmet.
For e-bikes that have a pedal assistance of 25 km/h or more, Swiss traffic regulations make helmet-wearing mandatory.
Remember that as a cyclist, you are subject to the same traffic rules as any other vehicle.
Respect other road users’ priority at crossroads and remain wary of other vehicles’ blind spots.
Vigilance and focus are key for road safety.  For that reason, wearing earphones and headphones while riding a bike is forbidden in Switzerland and France.
CERN offers an e-learning module on bike safety with useful information on regulations and good practices.
Taking the course is mandatory for anyone renting a CERN bike, and strongly recommended to anyone cycling on the Organization’s premises.
If, despite observing the recommended practices, you are victim of an accident or a near miss, or if you encounter a dangerous situation on the CERN site, please do not forget to complete an incident declaration.
These reports are used to improve safety at CERN, including road safety.
By reporting an incident, you are helping to prevent similar occurrences and thus reduce the accident toll.
Stay safe.

Industry and research – joining forces to accelerate progress and innovation.
CERN’s industrial suppliers are crucial to advancing its scientific mission.
It is through successful collaborations with businesses across a variety of industries that advancements in accelerators, detectors, computing and many other areas become realities.
It is often stated that CERN is a city within a city, and this requires efficient services of all types from a myriad of suppliers in order to function.
Moreover, it is its extraordinary engineering works that enable CERN to be at the pinnacle of fundamental science and thus deliver impact through innovation.
Procurement of supplies and services is thus central to CERN’s operation and advancement.
Furthermore, it remains a fundamental aspect of CERN’s economic impact across its Member and Associate Member States.
There are many laudable reasons why a given country may be motivated to be part of the CERN family, but it is clear that industrial return is a key motivator in many Member States due to its economic impact, as CERN spends nearly half of its annual budget on procurement over a wide range of goods and services.
Procurement provides not only direct financial returns, but also an opportunity to grow and learn.
Indeed, CERN’s Procurement group is in charge of building, developing and maintaining relations with industry and hence creating conditions for technological watch within the Member States.
This mutually beneficial relationship is fostered by CERN’s knowledge transfer activities, thanks to which firms can utilise CERN know-how and technologies for their own innovation.
In order to promote their national industries, Member States have traditionally organised targeted events called Industrial only are these events vital in matching industry capabilities, know-how and innovation with CERN projects and needs, but they are also essential elements for a balanced industrial return across the Member States.
During the pandemic, many of these events have taken place virtually, though we do hope that on-site events may again be possible in the future.
The organisation of these events is a demonstration of our dedication to the interests of our Member States and requires commitment from all members of the CERN personnel, from the top management to the technical experts.
It is also an opportunity for us to challenge our pre-conceptions about industry in the Member States, which is important to diversify our pool of suppliers and balance returns.
Going forward, I hope to see us hold more and more focused events, related to a given theme or to a specific event, drawing industry from across the Member States.
This should also focus the events for CERN experts, since the objective of such events is to develop contacts and match companies with the relevant CERN technical counterparts and procurement officers, in order to address the upcoming challenges and requirements at CERN.
CERN publishes its second public environment report.
The document details the current status of CERN’s environmental footprint, along with objectives for the coming years.
On 24 November, CERN published its second public environment report, covering the years 2019 and 2020.
In 2019, CERN made a commitment to communicate on its environmental footprint every two years in order to ensure transparency and demonstrate its leadership in environmental management for research organisations.
Like the first report, which covered the years 2017 and 2018, the second environment report has been prepared following the sustainability reporting standards laid out by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).
The period covered by the second report encompasses two years of CERN’s accelerator complex shutdown.
Consequently, the level of many environmental indicators decreased significantly with respect to the previous reporting cycle.
As an example, CERN’s electricity consumption in 2019 and 2020 was about 64% lower than when the machines were running.
Beyond presenting the current status of CERN’s environmental footprint, the report sets out the objectives for the coming years.  “The production of CERN’s first public environment report in 2020 enabled us to establish reporting frameworks and set concrete goals.
This second report is about turning words into action,” declares CERN’s Director-General, Fabiola Gianotti.
As an example, the Laboratory is committed to reducing its direct (scope 1) greenhouse gas emissions by 28% by the end of 2024.
In an effort to reach this goal, CERN has launched a leak repair campaign to decrease emissions from fluorinated gases in the large experiments.
In addition, this report innovates by presenting data on its indirect (scope 3) emissions for the first time, which includes emissions related to business travel, personnel commutes, catering, waste management and water purification.
This marks an important step in understanding and controlling the environmental impacts beyond CERN’s walls and upstream and downstream of the Organization’s supply chain.
The environmental impact of the HL-LHC is also discussed in the report.
In the long term, the new collider will enjoy better performances and a higher data per unit of energy used ratio – for which a metric has been developed and is presented in the report.
With respect to Run 1, the HL-LHC will increase the energy efficiency of CERN’s flagship facility by a factor of ten over 20 years.
Join the discussion on CERN and the environment in the dedicated Mattermost channel.

End of 2021 festivities @ CERN.
The festive season is around the corner, and many of you may wonder whether this can be marked at CERN.
COVID level 2 restrictions are currently in force on site and, with the rate of infections increasing in the local area, the Enlarged Directorate (ED) has decided that end-of-year work team gatherings will not be authorised on site this year.
While we all know how important end-of-year celebrations are for team spirit, a strict application of health-related measures remains key to keeping us all safe and reducing the risk of spreading the virus.
Beyond the CERN site, the COVID-19 restrictions in the Host States allow social gatherings, while stipulating self-isolation for all participants of such events if one of them tests positive.
That’s why the ED advises that working teams also avoid gatherings involving the whole team off the CERN site, as group self-isolation could seriously impact the work of the team.
Whatever your plans, and whoever you choose to socialise with, make your gatherings as safe as they can be by taking advantage of CERN’s self-testing system, which is available at 11 testing points on site.
Use the PLAMED platform to sign up for your self-test.
In the event of symptoms, please self-evaluate and self-declare on TRAMED.
Stay safe and enjoy the winter cheer.

IEEE honours Amalia Ballarino with James Wong Award at the International Conference on Magnet Technology.
Amalia Ballarino, Deputy Leader of the Magnets, Superconductors and Cryostats group in the Technology department, has piloted the development of superconductors and innovative superconducting systems
The 27th International Conference on Magnet Technology, which took place in Fukuoka, Japan, from 15 to 19 November, gave the superconductivity community at CERN reason to celebrate.
Amalia Ballarino, who has for decades led CERN’s efforts to develop superconductors and novel devices based on their use for the Organization’s accelerators, was awarded the James Wong Award for Continuing and Significant Contributions to Applied Superconductor Materials Technology from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
The announcement of the prize came in July this year and the ceremony took place on 18 November.
The IEEE stressed Ballarino’s role in the successful R&D programmes that led to establishing a winning role for magnesium diboride (MgB2) and high-temperature superconductors (HTS) in accelerator applications.
This success has led to the worldwide acceptance of high-temperature and MgB2 superconductors and heralded the development and use of MgB2 in transmission systems suitable for very high currents.
The IEEE further highlighted her commitment to building bridges between research and industry, showcased by her involvement in the development and production of these innovative systems at an industrial scale, and her R&D activity on superconductors (niobium–titanium, niobium–tin, MgB2 and HTS) for future particle accelerators.
After joining CERN as a PhD student in 1995, Ballarino worked on the reliable application of HTS in current leads, an innovation at the time.
Later in her career, she was responsible for the several thousand current leads that power the superconducting magnets of the LHC.
Following work on the commissioning of the LHC, Ballarino and her team delved into the development of MgB2-based transfer systems for the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), eventually making headlines in 2020 for operating the transmission of a whopping 110 kA (55 kA in each direction) over a 60-metre transmission link.  This work was undertaken in parallel with that of developing and purchasing the advanced low- and high-temperature superconductors required for the HL-LHC magnets.
The development of MgB2 for practical applications and the ingenious use of cabled wire in a transmission system made the technological prowess of the superconducting link possible.
MgB2, which was only recently discovered, transmits high current at up to 31 kelvin (-242°C), a higher temperature than conventional low-temperature superconductors, which sharply reduces operation costs and makes the technology susceptible to spread beyond particle accelerators.
Links like these, which can transfer vast amounts of current within a small volume, could for example be used to deliver electricity in big cities or to connect renewable energy sources to populated areas.
Liquid hydrogen is a potential coolant for such applications.
Amalia Ballarino is the first CERN expert to earn the IEEE James Wong Award for her pioneering work on superconductors.
She is the latest in a series of CERN experts to be awarded with similar IEEE prizes: Daniel Leroy, Lucio Rossi, Herman ten Kate, Robert Aymar, Arnaud Devred and Luca Bottura were also all honoured by the IEEE, which makes CERN home to more winners than any other institution.

Release of the WebEnergy 2.0 tool: managing your electricity consumption at CERN just got easier.
The new version of the app has a sleek new design as well as new features to better forecast energy consumption on site
It is no secret that the CERN accelerator complex consumes a vast amount of power – CERN’s global electricity consumption can easily be compared to that of a small city.
Understanding and modelling this consumption is key to drawing up CERN’s annual budget as it helps forecast short-term and long-term needs and bring about changes in behaviour towards more sustainable practices.
This is why the WebEnergy tool (link only accessible from within the CERN network) was initially created.
Through its interface, users can plot the electrical energy consumption and average power data over time at various levels of detail.
The tool is based on energy measurements from the medium voltage (18 kV or 3.3 kV) network, so the level of granularity does not reach 400/230 V consumer level.  Data presented by WebEnergy can then be used for a multitude of applications, including reports and virtual invoices (e.g. EDMS 2599454), an activity carried out within the Energy Management Panel (EMP) to promote energy awareness and energy efficiency.
WebEnergy 2.0, the latest upgrade of the app, introduces a new design for front-end users, but the real innovation is on the back end: it makes updating the counting structure easier thanks to a visual editor (see top figure) and a user-friendly balloon interface.
Moreover, WebEnergy 2.0 now includes an electricity forecasting tool, which generates a consumption profile based on the accelerator’s planned operation.
WebEnergy 2.0 is an evolutive platform and new features will be coming.
Most notably, the latest electricity forecast will soon be displayed on the front end and users will be able to navigate the counting structure in order to fully understand how energy is calculated and inform the Electrical Engineering group of potential discrepancies in the forecast.
CERN gets a monthly discount on electricity prices if the actual consumption is within 10% of the forecast.
Bismuth isotopes also alternate from spheres to rugby balls.
The unusual nuclear physics phenomenon, first discovered at CERN’s ISOLDE facility 50 years ago, had until now been seen only in mercury isotopes
Alternating from spheres to rugby balls is no longer the sole preserve of mercury isotopes, an international team at CERN’s ISOLDE facility reports in a paper published in Physical Review Letters.
Isotopes are forms of a chemical element that have the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei but a different number of neutrons.
Atomic nuclei are usually spherical or nearly spherical.
For a given element, though, when the number of neutrons changes, a gradual change in nuclear shape, or even a sudden one, can occur.
However, 50 years ago, an experiment at ISOLDE revealed that the nuclei of mercury isotopes actually alternate dramatically in shape, from a sphere to a pronounced rugby ball, as single neutrons are removed from, or added to, the nucleus.
The finding remains one of the most remarkable discoveries in nuclear physics in the past five decades, and scientists have wondered ever since whether elements other than mercury also display this unusual ‘shape-staggering’ phenomenon.
The new study conducted at ISOLDE, the very same facility at which the phenomenon was discovered, has now delivered an answer to this question.
By using ISOLDE’s ultrasensitive Resonance Ionisation Laser Ion Source, the team behind the study has now shown that bismuth isotopes also display shape staggering.
Specifically, examining bismuth nuclei produced at a challenging low rate of less than one atom per second, the team found that the nucleus of bismuth-188, which has 83 protons and 105 neutrons, has a much larger radius than those of its closest nuclear neighbours, bismuth-189, with one more neutron, and bismuth-187, with one fewer neutron.
Interestingly, such a sharp increase in radius, which reveals a change from a sphere to a pronounced rugby ball, occurs at the same number of neutrons, 105, as that at which shape staggering starts in the mercury isotopes.
“We had no indication from theory or experiment that bismuth nuclei would also exhibit shape staggering,” says Bruce Marsh of CERN and co-author of the study.
“Such light bismuth nuclei are remarkably difficult to make and study, and our best nuclear physics theories lack the power to predict the shape of these and other complex nuclei.”
If this experimental result wasn’t enough, the team gathered a unique collaboration of a dozen atomic-theory groups from five continents to extract nuclear properties from the ISOLDE measurements.
At the same time, the researchers performed state-of-the-art nuclear theoretical calculations, paving the way to understanding the shape-staggering phenomenon.
“We can’t tell whether or not we’ll find another instance of shape staggering, but one thing is clear, this behaviour is no longer unique to mercury isotopes,” concludes Marsh.
ALICE takes the next step in understanding the interaction between hadrons.
The ALICE collaboration has for the first time observed the residual strong interaction between protons and phi mesons
In an article recently published in Physical Review Letters, the ALICE collaboration has used a method known as femtoscopy to study the residual interaction between two-quark and three-quark particles.
Through this measurement, an interaction between the ɸ (phi) meson (strange-antistrange quarks) and a proton (two up quarks and one down quark) has been observed for the first time.
Since the ɸ meson is not electrically charged, an interaction between the proton and the ɸ cannot be of electromagnetic origin and can only be attributed to the residual strong interaction.
The strong interaction is what holds quarks together inside hadrons (such as the proton and the ɸ meson), while the residual strong interaction is the force that acts between hadrons.
This is the interaction that holds protons and neutrons together in the form of atomic nuclei.
Unlike the residual strong interaction between protons and neutrons, which can be studied in stable bound states like the nuclei, the interaction between unstable hadrons produced in particle collisions is very difficult to observe.
It was found to be possible in the LHC using an approach known as femtoscopy.
Hadrons in the LHC collisions are produced very close to each other, at distances of about 10^-15 m (a unit known as a femtometer, hence the name femtoscopy).
This scale matches the range of the residual strong force, giving the hadrons a brief chance to interact before flying away.
As a result, pairs of hadrons that experience an attractive interaction will move slightly closer to each other, while, for a repulsive interaction, the opposite occurs.
Both effects can be clearly observed through detailed analysis of the measured relative velocities of the particles.
The knowledge of the p-ɸ (proton-ɸ meson) interaction is of twofold interest in nuclear physics.
First, this interaction is an anchor point for searches for the partial restoration of chiral symmetry.
The left- and right-handed (chiral) symmetry that characterises the strong interaction is found to be broken in Nature, and this effect is responsible for the much larger mass of hadrons, such as the proton and the neutron, with respect to the masses of the quarks that make them up.
Hence, chiral symmetry is linked to the origin of mass itself!
A possible way of searching for the restoration of chiral symmetry and shedding light on the mechanism that generates mass is to study modifications of the properties of ɸ mesons within dense nuclear matter formed in collisions at the LHC.
However, for this purpose, it is essential that the simple two-body p-ɸ interaction in vacuum is first understood.
The second point of interest is that, due to its strange-antistrange quark content, the ɸ meson is regarded as a possible vehicle of the interaction among baryons (hadrons consisting of three quarks) that contain one or more strange quarks, called hyperons (Y).
Depending on the strength of this interaction, hyperons may form the core of neutron stars, which are among the densest and least understood astrophysical objects.
Direct measurement of the Y-ɸ interaction strength, although feasible, has not yet been carried out, but already today this quantity can be estimated on the basis of the p-ɸ findings via fundamental symmetries.
Therefore, measuring p-ɸ interaction provides indirect access to the Y-Y interaction in neutron stars.
The moderate interaction strength measured by ALICE provides a quantitative reference for further studies of the ɸ properties within the nuclear medium and also translates into a negligible interaction among hyperons in neutron stars.
More accurate measurements will follow during the upcoming LHC Runs 3 and 4, allowing the precision of the extracted parameters to be significantly improved and also making it possible to pin down the Y-ɸ interaction directly.

Computer Security: Multifactor for the masses.
The ultimate silver bullet to protect your account, computer and data is using a sufficiently complex and unique password combined with a second-factor token, i.e. in addition to the password you know, something you have, like your smartphone or a hardware token.
This authentication process is known as two-factor authentication.  It presents a huge hurdle for any attacker, as they would need to not only acquire your password, which can be achieved virtually (“CERN has been phished again”), but also physically steal your hardware token.
And you would know if your smartphone got lost, wouldn’t you?
While, in 2020, CERN focused on rolling out two-factor authentication for experts needing to access and administer certain computing services, and while two-factor authentication will become mandatory for remote access to control systems installed on and connected to CERN’s Technical Network (“Protecting the accelerator from remote evil”), in 2022, we would like to take the next step: using two-factor authentication when logging into any CERN web application.
The idea behind this new two-factor option is that CERN’s web-based Single Sign-On (SSO) portal would require you to authenticate with both your password and your second factor for any website behind CERN’s web-based SSO1, regardless of whether it’s to access a critical control system, administer a very important computing service or just browse the CERN phonebook or any other webpage behind the SSO.
You can use a dedicated one-time password generation app on your smartphone – so your smartphone is that second hardware token – or a physical USB token (e.g.  “Yubikey”) that uses a CERN-dedicated private/public keypair for that second authentication step.
Once authenticated correctly, you can continue working as normal and your session will stay active for 12 hours or until you change your browser or log in from another device.
This would give you, your account and your data the ultimate protection against identity theft and password exposure.
Deployment of this silver bullet will pave the way for a wider roll-out in the future, but it requires a fundamental change in how authentication is done technically today.
Hence, starting in the second quarter of 2022, all experts with access to critical control systems (e.g. via the BE department’s ROGs), IT systems (e.g. using Foreman) or sensitive data, i.e. those experts already using two-factor authentication on CERN’s SSO for their work, will have this new two-factor web authentication feature enabled by default given the critical nature of their account (unless they opt out and also lose their privileged access).
This will facilitate their login and avoid the need for multiple single- and multi-factor logins during the day.
People who are using CERN computing facilities “only” for their research duties and scientific endeavours can opt into this feature through the IT User Portal, and we hope that as many people as possible value their protection highly enough to take this additional step – a step that is common when accessing your bank account, for instance.
So, why not give it a try for the sake of security and the protection of your account and digital life?
Check out all the details (like how to activate a second factor or what to do if you lose it) on our dedicated webpage.

What like a beam can undeceive! (*With apologies to Herman Melville).
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has recently completed a two-week beam test following a lengthy post-Long Shutdown 2 (LS2) campaign of hardware commissioning, magnet circuit powering tests and dipole training.
The dipole training was not without issues.
Two separate quench-induced faults made it necessary to warm up two sectors: one for a magnet exchange (sector 78) and the other for a bypass diode exchange (sector 23).
With the warm-up and cool-down of a sector taking a total of around 10 weeks, the elapsed time for both interventions was four to five months.
A two-week beam test in the latter part of the year was always on the cards and, once the schedule had been adapted to accommodate the knock-on effects of the repairs, final preparations started on the evening of Thursday, 14 October.
Lack of time to fully recommission the magnet circuits of the two sectors meant that the test was limited, in the most part, to beam at 450 GeV.
With the experiments’ caverns closed and vacuum valves open, a thorough checkout without beam saw extensive tests of the machine protection systems, as well as other key systems, such as injection and beam dump.
Following the checkout, circulating beams were established on the evening of Tuesday, 19 October.
What followed was an impressive tour de force.
Days and nights were dedicated to a dense programme of set-up with beam of various systems (RF, collimation, beam dump, injection and the remarkably versatile transverse feedback system), machine protection tests, measurement and correction of optics (revealing crossed connections on two quadrupoles at Point 3), aperture measurements (all good except…†), commissioning of beam instrumentation (beam position and beam loss monitors, tune measurement, profile measurements (synchrotron light, wire scanners)), tune and orbit feedback systems, injection and dump line studies and so on.
Software tools – such as automatic beam loss maps, automatic alignment of collimators and luminosity scans – were successfully commissioned.
The availability of the whole accelerator complex during the period was around an eminently respectable 90%.  All this led to collisions and stable beams (at 450 GeV) and the chance for the LHC experiments to check out the performance of their upgraded detectors.
FASER (Forward Search Experiment) saw first tracks going through the full detector for the first time.
The success of the test from the experiments’ perspective was marked by the arrival of the traditional bottles of champagne, which, once emptied, will take their place on display in the CERN Control Centre.
As a coda, a ramp of pilot bunches to 3.5 TeV was performed without problems.
Over the years, I’ve spent enough time in the control room to at least partially appreciate what the achievements of these two weeks represent.
The confluence of the rigorous technical work on all accelerator and technical systems during LS2, deep preparation and testing, years of experience, a permanent eye on the destructive potential of the beam and the hardware, the development of tools and instruments, system operability, a profound grasp of the accelerator physics involved, the understanding that the processes and problems are amenable to understanding, all bound together by a tremendously collaborative culture.
An appropriate testament to the commitment, passion and the more concrete investments that have gone into the LHC.
---
† The beam, however, was to have the last word and duly undeceived once more.
An unidentified lying object (ULO) was revealed by beam losses during the test, and its profile and location were rapidly established.
Radiography and tomography revealed a rogue RF finger from a magnet interconnect plug-in module in the aperture of the beam.
After evaluation of the potential impact of running with the finger in place during Run 3, the decision was taken to warm up the sector concerned and fix it.
This will shift the planned 2022 start-up with beam a bit – planning to be revised in due course.
Detectors for a new era of ATLAS physics.
The New Small Wheel system joins the ATLAS experiment after nearly a decade of design and construction
The High-Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) will dramatically increase the rate of collisions in the ATLAS experiment.
While offering an opportunity for physicists to explore some of the rarest processes in the universe, the large collision rate brings new challenges – in particular, higher radiation levels and significantly more data.
The ATLAS collaboration is adapting to deal with these challenges by upgrading all parts of its detectors with new, state-of-the-art instruments.
“The Muon New Small Wheels (NSW) are the first new detectors in ATLAS specifically designed to handle high-luminosity conditions,” says ATLAS Spokesperson Andreas Hoecker.
“The installation of the second – and final – NSW follows nearly a decade of dedicated efforts by ATLAS members, who designed, constructed and assembled this high-tech muon detector from scratch.”
Cutting-edge technology
The ATLAS NSW system is made up of two wheel-shaped detectors, sitting at opposite ends of the experimental cavern.
Named in comparison to ATLAS’s 25-metre “big wheel” detectors, each NSW weighs more than 100 tonnes and is nearly 10 metres in diameter.
More important than size is function.
The NSW detectors are at the forefront of detector design, using two innovative gaseous detector technologies: micromegas (MM) and small-strip thin-gap chambers (sTGC).
These provide both fast and precise muon-tracking capabilities.
“The improved spatial resolution allowed by the NSW will be especially critical for the ATLAS “trigger”, the system that decides which collision events to store and which to discard.
The trigger will rely on the NSW’s excellent resolution to confirm whether a particle originated from the interaction point, thus reducing our chances of saving data from unwanted background events,” says Mario Antonelli, NSW Phase 1 Upgrade Project Leader.
The readout capabilities of the overall system are staggering: two million MM readout channels and 350,000 sTGC electronic readout channels.
Each wheel has 16 sectors, each containing two layers of MM and sTGC chambers with four measurement planes apiece, providing the physicists with useful redundancy as they trace a muon’s track through the detectors.
The dance of detectors
While 2021 has seen the NSW detectors journey underground, this was not their first time on the move.  “The NSW effort was multinational, with members from across the global ATLAS collaboration contributing to construction and design,” says Philipp Fleischmann, ATLAS Muon System Project Leader.
After the original wheels were officially retired, NSW “A” was driven from Building 191 to the ATLAS surface hall on 6 July and, six days later, lowered into the ATLAS cavern where it was moved into its final position between the calorimeter endcap cryostat and the endcap toroid magnets.
This momentous occasion was repeated for the NSW “C” four months later, as it was lowered into the ATLAS cavern on 4 November.
“That the team managed to keep the project on track despite a global pandemic and the tragic loss of their project leader, Stephanie Zimmermann, is a testament to their incredible talent and dedication,” says ATLAS Technical Coordinator Ludovico Pontecorvo.
New wheels in motion
The NSW detectors will be instrumental in Run 3 data taking, as a moderate increase in luminosity is already planned for the LHC.
While waiting to see the wheels in action, the ATLAS collaboration turns its focus to the next major upgrades of the experiment.  “The next long shutdown of the LHC (LS3, scheduled for 2025) will be the last before the HL-LHC begins operation,” says Francesco Lanni, ATLAS Upgrade Coordinator.  “We have a lot to accomplish in the intervening years, including the construction and assembly of an entire new inner tracking system.
But with each new upgrade, we get one step closer to the next chapter of LHC physics and the exciting discoveries that may lay within.”
­­­­­Key to the success of the New Small Wheel was its former project leader, ATLAS physicist Stephanie Zimmermann.
Her sudden death in November 2020 left a hole in the tight-knit NSW family.
In her honour – and wishing to fulfil her dream of seeing the NSW installed – a photo of Stephanie was attached to NSW “A” as it was lowered into the experiment.
A full obituary was published in tribute to Stephanie in the CERN Bulletin.

Gennady Zinovjev (1941 – 2021).
Professor Gennady Zinovjev, a prominent theorist in the field of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and the physics of strongly interacting matter, a pioneer in experimental studies of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and a leader of the Ukraine–CERN collaboration, passed away on 19 October 2021 at the age of 80.
In a career spanning more than fifty years, Genna, as he was known to most of his friends, made phenomenal theoretical contributions to many different topics, ranging from analytical and perturbative QCD to phenomenology and from hard probes and photons to hadrons and particle chemistry.
His scientific activities were concentrated around experimental facilities at CERN and the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), Dubna. Professor Zinovjev was one of the key initiators of the NICA complex at JINR, played a pivotal role in Ukraine becoming an Associate Member State of CERN and was one of the founding members of the ALICE collaboration at CERN.
Born on 18 April 1941 in the city of Birobidzhan (Russian Far East), in 1963 he graduated from Dnepropetrovsk State University, a branch of Moscow State University named after M. V. Lomonosov.
From 1964 to 1967, he studied at the graduate school of the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics of JINR.
From 1967 to 1968 he was a researcher at the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science of the Academy of Sciences of the Moldavian SSR (Chisinau).
He was awarded the title of Doctor of Physics and Mathematics in 1975 at the Dubna Laboratory of Theoretical Physics (now Bogolyubov Laboratory of Theoretical Physics). He then joined the Kiev Institute for Theoretical Physics (now Bogolyubov Institute for Theoretical Physics) of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, firstly as a staff member and then, from 1986, as Head of the Department of High-Energy-Density Physics.
In 2006, he was awarded the Certificate of Honour of the Verkhovna Rada (Parliament) of Ukraine.
In 2008, he was awarded the Prize of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine named after A.S. Davydov, before becoming a member of the National Academy in 2012.
In the mid-1990s, he initiated Ukraine’s participation in ALICE, and soon started to play a key role in the conception and construction of the Inner Tracking System (ITS), and more generally in the creation of ALICE – both the experiment and the collaboration.
Overcoming innumerable practical and bureaucratic obstacles, he identified technical and technological expertise within the Ukrainian academic and research environment, and then managed and led the development and fabrication of novel ultra-lightweight electrical substrates for vertex and tracking detectors.
These developments, which took place at the Kharkiv Scientific Research Technological Institute of Instrument Engineering, resulted in technologies and components that formed the backbone of the ITS 1 and ITS 2 detectors.
He was the Deputy Chair of the ALICE Collaboration Board from 2011 to 2013 and also served as a member of the ALICE Management Board during that time.
Genna was one of those rare people who are equally comfortable with theory, experiment, science, politics and human interactions.
He was a passionate scientist, deeply committed to the Ukrainian scientific community. He did not hesitate to make great personal sacrifices to pursue what he considered important for science, his students and colleagues.
Equally influential was his prominent role as a teacher and mentor for a steady stream of talents, both experimentalists and theorists, who received a rigorous education in Kiev and spread from there to many places all over the world.
Many of us in the heavy-ion physics community owe him a great deal.
We express our deepest condolences to Professor Zinovjev’s family and his colleagues and friends at the Bogolyubov Institute for Theoretical Physics and the Kharkiv Scientific Research Technological Institute of Instrument Engineering.
We will always remember him for his charismatic personality, great kindness, openness and generosity.
The ALICE collaboration
ALICE 3 workshop: towards a next-generation heavy-ion experiment for the 2030s.
On 18 and 19 October, ALICE held a workshop on ALICE 3, the next-generation heavy-ion experiment for Run 5 of the LHC and beyond.
This new heavy-ion programme will address some of the physics questions that are not accessible with Runs 3 and 4.
First discussed within the ALICE collaboration and at the heavy-ion town hall meeting in 2018, an expression of interest on the follow-up to ALICE was drawn up and submitted as input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics update.
At the beginning of 2020, dedicated working groups were then set up in order to work out the physics case, the physics performance and a detector concept.
The ALICE 3 workshop programme involved a mix of presentations on ALICE 3 physics performance studies and invited presentations outlining the landscape of theory and experiment over the next decade.
The workshop took place in a hybrid format and was attended by more than 300 participants, both at CERN and via Zoom.
A major goal of ALICE 3 is to quantitatively understand the connection between heavy quark transport and hadronisation, e.g. by measuring beauty meson and baryon production and azimuthal asymmetries as well as azimuthal correlations between charm and anti-charm mesons and the production of multi-charm baryons.
Another key area is the determination of the temperature and how particles flow in the quark–gluon plasma (QGP) in the early stage of the collision through measurements of real and virtual photon emission.
Virtual photon emission is also sensitive to chiral symmetry restoration and, in particular, the mixing of the rho and a1 mesons at high temperatures.
ALICE 3 would provide unique access to these topics and open up new possibilities in other areas too.
In order to achieve the required performance, a novel detector concept is being proposed, with an ultra-light tracker based on silicon pixel sensors, covering the pseudo-rapidity range of -4 to +4 and installed within a superconducting magnet system.
A high-resolution vertex detector, retractably mounted inside the beam pipe, provides the ultimate pointing resolution.
The tracking is complemented by particle identification over the full acceptance, realised with different technologies, including Si-based time-of-flight sensors.
Further specialised detectors extend the physics reach in various areas.
The workshop was the first ALICE event with significant in-person participation since the start of the COVID-19 restrictions.
It also marked the start of discussions of ALICE 3 with the community at large and of the review process with the LHC Experiments Committee (LHCC).
Environmental awareness: An environmental perspective on managing hazardous liquids.
How are hazardous liquids managed at CERN, and what are the consequences for the environment?
CERN uses various hazardous chemicals for carrying out a range of activities, both industrial and experimental.
These chemicals include cleaning products, substances for treating accelerator equipment, polymers, various petroleum-derived products, organic fluids and corrosive and toxic liquids.
These chemicals are used in a wide range of applications, such as for electrical insulation, lubrication for machining metallic or non-metallic materials in workshops, and fuel for electrical generators.
If accidentally released, these liquids will have a serious impact on the environment, in particular on aquatic fauna.
CERN is surrounded by low-flow watercourses, which are very sensitive to even minor releases.
Non-toxic substances, like organic oils, can also cause serious damage by reducing the oxygenation of a watercourse.
All chemicals therefore need to be carefully managed.
In line with general prevention principles, the use of hazardous chemicals must be avoided where possible.
For example, mechanical cleaning should be favoured over cleaning using solvents.
When it cannot be avoided, the least hazardous chemical should be selected.
The activities concerned should be regularly reviewed in the light of these prevention principles.
When using hazardous liquids, various protection measures should be implemented during handling and storage, such as retention basins, spill kits for managing leaks, and clear and understandable labelling.
Personnel working with chemical agents must be properly trained and familiar with safety procedures to ensure that hazardous liquids are used safely.
Finally, all chemicals (gas, solid and liquid) must be registered in the Chemical Register for Environment, Health and Safety (CERES).
This centralised database provides the appropriate CERN services with all the relevant safety information.
It includes both chemical and environmental risk assessment methods and presents the evolution of the risk score over the years.
CERN experts are available to support the identification and evaluation of hazardous substances and to propose mitigation measures.
An e-learning course is also available if you want to learn more about chemical safety at CERN.

President of the Swiss Confederation visits CERN.
The President of the Swiss Confederation, Guy Parmelin, honoured CERN with his presence on Friday, 5 November 2021.
He was accompanied by representatives of the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research (DEFR) and the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAE).  At Point 1 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the Swiss Head of State met Director-General Fabiola Gianotti, Director for Research and Computing Joachim Mnich, Director for Accelerators and Technology Mike Lamont, Director for International Relations Charlotte Warakaulle, Director for Finance and Human Resources Raphaël Bello, Head of Member State Relations Paul Collier and Professor Felicitas Pauss from ETH Zurich, who was the President ad interim of the Foundation Council of the Swiss National Science Foundation from 2018 to 2019.
Guy Parmelin and Fabiola Gianotti visited the ATLAS experiment cavern with collaboration spokesperson Andreas Hoecker and physicists from ATLAS.
Mike Lamont, joined by young Swiss researchers, then welcomed the delegation to Point 1 of the LHC tunnel.
Back on the surface, the Swiss President visited the large magnet assembly facility in Building 180 and rounded off his visit with a discussion with young Swiss scientists and engineers at the Globe of Science and Innovation, from where he was also able to view the progress of the CERN Science Gateway construction works.
Switzerland’s importance for CERN cannot be overstated.
Hosted on Swiss soil since 1954, the Organization has enjoyed the steadfast support of the Swiss government ever since, and has benefited from invaluable contributions from Swiss industry and the country’s particle physics community.
That community, spearheaded by institutes renowned for their theoretical and experimental physics programmes, is particularly active in the ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments at the LHC.
Flexible and accessible, the HiRadMat facility celebrates its tenth anniversary.
Since its construction in 2011, HiRadMat has been a unique experimental facility for testing materials under beam impact
HiRadMat (High-Radiation to Materials) has been a key European facility for material testing for ten years now.
It is designed to provide high-intensity, high-momentum pulsed beams to an irradiation area where accelerator components, high-power targets and various other material samples can be tested.
“HiRadMat was originally conceived in 2009 as a test bench for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collimators at a time when ad hoc installations were the baseline for such tests.
Management approval and the securing of EU funding in 2010 got the ball rolling for the irradiation facility, and the construction was successfully completed in 2011,” says Ilias Efthymiopoulos, the Project Leader for the HiRadMat construction.  “A challenge in the building of HiRadMat was the dismantling of the old T1 target of the West Area and the T9 target of West Area Neutrino Facility.
The special tools we developed as part of the dismantling campaign are now used widely at CERN.”
“From the start, strong emphasis was put on offering exceptionally flexible beamline optics,” explains Malika Meddahi, Deputy Director for Accelerators and Technology and former Project Leader for beamline design, construction and commissioning.  “The beam is extracted from the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) using the same extraction channel as LHC beam 1, then sent down the existing TT60 transfer line, from which the HiRadMat primary beamline (TT66) branches off after about 200 metres, offering spot sizes of 0.2–4 mm to the various experiments in a flexible way.”
Following the first experiments (starting with the test of a tungsten powder target under a high-power pulsed beam), several facilities at CERN based their designs on the data provided by HiRadMat experiments.  “In the field of beam interception, we have tested particle-producing target prototypes, conducted R&D on advanced materials and carried out investigations on refractory materials,” explains Marco Calviani, Leader of the Targets, Collimators and Dumps section.
From the beginning, HiRadMat has been part of Transnational Access programmes EuCARD, EuCARD-2 and ARIES, making the facility accessible to users from all over the world.
Today, the facility provides up to 2 x 1016 protons per year.  “For the past ten years, HiRadMat experiments have been pushing the frontiers of beam-to-material knowledge, with 42 experiments successfully completed,” says Nikos Charitonidis, from the Experimental Areas group, who is responsible for the facility at CERN and chair of its technical board.
HiRadMat experiments are evaluated according to scientific criteria by a board of external experts.
Among these specialists is Bernie Riemer, chair of the board and scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  “Our role allows us to witness exciting developments in technology, materials and fundamental research for the benefit of CERN and worldwide collaborators.”
A key member of the board and its first chair was the late Nick Simos from Brookhaven National Laboratory, who passed away in 2020.  “We lost a mentor, friend and leader who worked actively to incite members, users and CERN staff,” recalls Bernie.
The legacy of Nick and of the HiRadMat team is already strong, as Verena Kain, Leader of the SPS Operation section, stresses: “HiRadMat has certainly helped to further increase the flexibility and versatility of the CERN LHC injectors.”
The story will continue during Run 3, as it has in 2021 with three CERN experiments: BLM3, for the calibration and verification of the LHC beam loss monitors; Multimat2, a critical benchmark of collimator materials in view of the HL-LHC upgrades; and HED, an important validation of high-energy dump design materials.
With the next upgrade coming up, aiming to prepare the facility for more luminous and energetic beams, HiRadMat still has its best days ahead of it.  “Studies are ongoing to upgrade the layout and key beam elements in order to allow for maximum beam intensities and brightness thanks to the LHC Injectors Upgrade project, enabling the facility to address a number of new experiments that the community is eagerly awaiting,” says Markus Brugger, Experimental Areas Group Leader.
This article is dedicated to Nick Simos.
Get your free reflective tags in CERN restaurants on 18 November.
It’s time to reflect!
In the dark, it’s hard for motorists to see pedestrians on the side of the road.
While pedestrians can see a car approaching from afar, they’re effectively invisible to the driver unless they’re wearing something reflective.
On 18 November, the HSE unit will distribute free reflective tags to the CERN community in Restaurants 1, 2 and 3 at lunchtime.
They’re small, neat, and they come with a metal chain so that they can be attached to your clothes or a bag.
They’ll make you visible from a distance of 125 metres and therefore safer on the streets this winter.
This is the third year that the HSE unit has been running the campaign (there was no distribution in 2020), and the new reflective tag design is an homage to 50 years of hadron colliders at CERN, modelled on the cross-section of an Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) magnet.
Be seen – be safe!
A video on reflective gear is available on CDS.
Two CERN physicists take up the mystery boxes challenge set by local primary schools.
Will CERN physicists Mar Capeans and Tapan Nayak use their knowledge of the fundamental properties of matter wisely to detect what’s inside the boxes?
For the last 10 years, as part of the Be a Scientist project, local schools have been receiving strange mystery boxes from CERN.
Like researchers who are looking for invisible elementary particles, the pupils make hypotheses, collect data and use evidence as they set out to identify the contents of the boxes without opening them.
As the project celebrates its 10th anniversary, the tables have been turned.
Pupils from Jean de la Fontaine school (Prévessin-Moëns, France) and Cérésole school (Petit-Lancy, Switzerland) have hidden various objects in two boxes and set a challenge for CERN scientists to find out what’s inside in just six months.
In the ALICE experiment’s cavern, Mar Capeans (Head of the Site and Civil Engineering department) and Tapan Nayak (Experimental Physicist) are the third team to take up the challenge.
Based on the notes left by Katy Foraz and Andre Henriques, the previous team to conduct investigations, Mar and Tapan carried out new experiments.
While the infrared camera didn’t reveal anything, it seems that a magnet brought close to the French box causes it to beep.
Is that a metal detector inside?
Dorota Grabowska and Alberto Di Meglio will tell us more in the next episode of the Schools’ Challenge!
This video is available on CDS.

A triple treat from CMS.
In a first for particle physics, the CMS collaboration has observed three J/ψ particles emerging from a single collision between two protons
It’s a triple treat.
By sifting through data from particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the CMS collaboration has seen not one, not two but three J/ψ particles emerging from a single collision between two protons.
In addition to being a first for particle physics, the observation opens a new window into how quarks and gluons are distributed inside the proton.
The J/ψ particle is a special particle.  It was the first particle containing a charm quark to be discovered, winning Burton Richter and Samuel Ting a Nobel prize in physics and helping to establish the quark model of composite particles called hadrons.
Experiments including ATLAS, CMS and LHCb at the LHC have previously seen one or two J/ψ particles coming out of a single particle collision, but never before have they seen the simultaneous production of three J/ψ particles – until the new CMS analysis.
The trick?  Analysing the vast amount of high-energy proton–proton collisions collected by the CMS detector during the second run of the LHC, and looking for the transformation of the J/ψ particles into pairs of muons, the heavier cousins of the electrons.
From this analysis, the CMS team identified five instances of single proton–proton collision events in which three J/ψ particles were produced simultaneously.
The result has a statistical significance of more than ﬁve standard deviations – the threshold used to claim the observation of a particle or process in particle physics.
These three-J/ψ events are very rare.
To get an idea, one-J/ψ events and two-J/ψ events are about 3.7 million and 1800 times more common, respectively.
“But they are well worth investigating,” says CMS physicist Stefanos Leontsinis, “A larger sample of three-J/ψ events, which the LHC should be able to collect in the future, should allow us to improve our understanding of the internal structure of protons at small scales.”

Computer Security: SAFER Teamwork.
A global trust group protecting research & education infrastructures from cyberthreats is born
SAFER is a new operational security trust group focused on fighting computer misuse and defending the academic, research, and education mission as a global community.
SAFER (Security Assistance For Education & Research), is a group of independent security professionals that is fully member-driven.
It was founded by Research and Education (R&E) security experts joining forces, and is supported by their respective organizations, including CERN, DFN-CERT, ESET, ESnet, LBNL, STFC and WLCG.
Why?  Most R&E organizations do not have the resources or expertise to manage threats arising from international criminal organizations or nation states.
SAFER builds on the decades of experience its members have in building international cooperation, sharing information, and operating across borders in order to solve complex human and technical challenges.
Defending R&E services and people as a global community is the only way forward.
Existing security groups provide invaluable services to their constituencies and operational security support within their circle of action.
However, since attacks are global we need a concerted and global effort to connect these groups.
Until now, central coordination of global attacks, a critical component for the successful resolution of security incidents, was everyone’s business but nobody’s job.
SAFER aims to provide systematic, comprehensive, enduring, and truly global incident response and threat intelligence sharing capabilities for the R&E sector as a whole.
It does so by liaising with R&E communities worldwide and fostering collaboration on the operational security issues affecting them all.
Building on top of a secure communications platform, help to other organizations could take the form of:
sharing threat intelligence to support daily security operations providing informal emergency incident response assistance between members offering members’ unique or rare security expertise to support an investigation
SAFER does not accept applications for membership: new candidates are nominated by their peers within the trust group, those who are actively working with them to defend the R&E sector against malicious actors.
The best way of being nominated to become a member is to make meaningful contributions in the operational security area of the R&E sector and become a recognized, valued, and trusted individual by the trust group peers.
Additional details are available at SAFER members annually elect a steering group, which oversees the services operated by SAFER, ensures SAFER is best positioned to fulfil its mission and follow its core values, aims at maintaining the highest level of trust in and within the group, as well as between members.
The SAFER steering group can be reached at

Environmental awareness: CERN's process for minimising environmental noise.
In the design phase of a new project, CERN takes into account the 2018 reference levels for noise limits, the new noise source characteristics, and noise from existing infrastructure.
The data is then processed by a 3D georeferenced modelling software.
Mitigation measures are defined where needed, based on the results of the modelling.
Before the operation phase of new equipment, the Organization controls noise to verify that the levels remain within the set limits.
In addition, CERN monitors the noise impact of existing equipment through noise campaigns organised annually in the month of September.
Mitigation measures are defined where noise levels exceed the set limits.
Questions regarding environmental noise can be sent

The North Area is getting a fresh look.
The North Area, part of the Super Proton Synchrotron complex, will see a major two-phased facelift in the upcoming years
As the second-largest accelerator at CERN, the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) is an indispensable machine that provides beams not only to the LHC and AWAKE, but also to many fixed-target experiments, including SHINE, NA62, COMPASS, NA64 and NA65, and various R&D programmes, through 6 kilometres of beamlines supplying the North Area's experimental halls .
The first beams from the North Area, which was built in the 1970s, were sent to the experiments in 1978.
Initially, the area was dedicated almost exclusively to physics experiments, but over the years many beam lines have also served a very dynamic programme of R&D and tests for experiments at CERN colliders, other labs and even in space.
New experiments will also see the light of day in the future, following the Physics Beyond Colliders (PBC) initiative.
The initial design of the North Area (NA) was very sound, allowing for perpetual changing requirements for more than 40 years.
However, most of the equipment and infrastructure is just as old, and the time has come to give the NA a fresh look and to prepare the beamlines and infrastructure for the coming decades.
New experiments constantly require higher intensities, putting the equipment under strain and necessitating maximum reliability.
Discussions about the refurbishment of the NA began as early as 2013, when Long Shutdown 1 was about to start.
As the area has been in operation since 1978, when the SPS was first switched on, the equipment hasn’t really been touched since.
Initial consolidation work on the safety of the installations in the NA took place during Long Shutdown 2 (LS2).
However, the daily fixes needed on the power converters in the NA raised reliability questions that needed to be addressed.
As of 2021, a two-phased approach has been endorsed for the consolidation of the NA that will allow the full renovation costs to be staged.
Phase 1, approved as of 17 June 2021 through the Medium-Term Plan, has already started and will focus on the replacement of the power converters in BA80 and BA2, covering the first 1.2 kilometres of beamlines upstream of the experimental halls.
This replacement will take place during Long Shutdown 3, which is scheduled to end in mid-2027, so as not to hamper Run 3.
The first visible result of the consolidation activities will appear in 2023, with the construction of a fifth cooling tower to handle the future cooling needs.
Phase 2, starting in 2027, will be the refurbishment of the experimental halls and of auxiliary technical buildings BA81 and 82.
We are talking here of about 60 000 square metres of buildings, facilities including North Experimental Halls 1 and 2 (EHN1 and EHN2) and underground cavern ECN3, which are essential for the searches for rare processes in the framework of the PBC Study.
The NA consolidation project will not result in the same energy savings as the East Area (EA) makeover.
The main reason is its major energy consumer.  The duty cycle, that is the fraction of the time during which beam is actually delivered, is much larger than in the EA.
Moreover, the big experimental magnets run constantly and cannot be pulsed.
Nevertheless, the upgrades of the beam equipment and interlock protection will help reduce beam losses, building refurbishments will allow for energy savings and the project will investigate further means to improve energy consumption in several related areas.
The facelift will bring the NA facilities into compliance with modern safety requirements.
In addition, the SPS itself has been majorly upgraded during LS2.
All beams are now accelerated by a renewed and improved radiofrequency system.
While mainly geared to increase the intensity and quality of beams to the LHC, the beam parameters to the NA may also benefit soon.
A new beam dump has been installed at Point 5 of the accelerator ring to cope with these higher intensity beams that will be commissioned during Run 3, and then needed as of 2027 for the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider.

CERN Accelerator School to create new video encyclopaedia.
After a long hiatus due to the pandemic, CAS has finally restarted its residential courses. This time with a new project: a CAS video encyclopaedia. It is a cool Tuesday afternoon in early October.
In the shadow of the Jura mountains north of Geneva lies a hotel, where seventy students at the beginning of their accelerator physics careers are attending the CERN Accelerator School (CAS).
They are joined by experts from various international accelerators who lecture, share their expertise and network with the students.
This particular course, Introduction to Accelerator Physics, is CAS’s first residential course since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The school began in 1983, with a mandate of “assembling and disseminating knowledge on accelerator science”.
Hermann Schmickler, the current CAS director, explained that this mandate refers to “the theoretical aspects of beam dynamics, but also the technologies involved in building an accelerator and the various types of accelerators that exist around the world: colliders, synchrotrons, light sources and accelerators for medical applications”.
In the centre of the Introduction to Accelerator Physics conference room stands a video camera, which betrays the beginning of an ambitious new project from the CAS team: CASopedia.  Its aim is to record and catalogue all CAS lectures and to release all the content in open access on the CAS website – helpful not only to those who have been unable to attend an in-person course, but also to those who may wish to refresh their knowledge.
Some institutions have also already expressed an interest in using the CASopedia footage as teaching material.
Schmickler explained that the team is planning to record every lecture on every course for the next five years, resulting in over 1600 hours of footage.  “But listening attentively to a one-hour course if you are looking for specific information could be very frustrating”.  Instead, CAS intends to sort the videos in a searchable video encyclopaedia (hence the name).  Searching keywords in the database will provide targeted five to ten-minute-long video explanations from accelerator physics experts.
CASopedia is only one of many recent CAS developments.
For instance, the introductory course was completely reviewed in 2018 by expert accelerator physicists, who will meet regularly to review the other courses.  “This is like quality assurance”, adds Schmickler.
Furthermore, before the pandemic, CAS started increasing the frequency of its courses throughout the year.  Two general courses (a yearly introductory course and an advanced course every other year) and up to four specialist courses.
However, during the pandemic, only two online courses took place.
These had high attendance but, as the effects of the pandemic lessen, more residential courses are scheduled for next year in various venues across Europe.
Countdown to Dark Matter Day.
CERN joins the global celebration of Dark Matter Day on and around 31 October with several activities
On and around 31 October, CERN and other laboratories around the world will celebrate the global hunt for the universe’s missing matter – the dark matter that is thought to make up most of the matter in space.
Experiments worldwide are searching for this unseen matter using many different tools, such as telescopes in space and on the ground, particle beams and deep underground detectors.
CERN is home to several experiments that seek out the particles that may make up dark matter.
These include experiments based at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), such as ATLAS and CMS, which have broken new ground in the search for dark-matter particles, and non-LHC experiments such as CAST and NA64, which too have added new knowledge about the properties of these hypothetical particles.
The Laboratory also hosts the control centre of AMS, a detector that was assembled at CERN and installed on the International Space Station to measure cosmic rays and try to shed light on their nature, as well as that of dark matter and antimatter.
Between 25 October and 4 November, Dark Matter Day activities, in physical or virtual form, will share what we know and don’t know about dark matter with audiences worldwide.
CERN will take part, hosting several activities: a production uniting the arts and the sciences at the Laboratory’s Globe of Science and Innovation on 27 October; a virtual booth in an online exhibition space where anyone from anywhere can freely explore the different booths and learn about dark matter; and a series of social-media activities on CERN’s Facebook, Twitter and Instagram channels featuring CERN scientists answering questions from followers across the globe, like those in last year’s event (see video below).
Check out the Dark Matter Day website to find out more and follow #DarkMatterDay and #DarkMatterDay2021.
Dark Matter Day is sponsored by the Interactions Collaboration, and this year’s event is dedicated to the memory of Glenn Roberts of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, who founded Dark Matter Day and passed away earlier this year.
The video is available on YouTube.
Wright Colloquium for Science at the University of Geneva in November.
The University of Geneva will host a special one-off public lecture on 2 November in the Dufour building and online to complement last year's Wright Colloquium for Science.
This year's event continues the theme of last year's Colloquium: "The Art of Maths", and accompanies a maths-themed sound and light show in the Parc des Bastions, which had to be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
You will be able to watch the “Maths et Brilliant” sound and light show at the Parc des Bastions every evening at 6 p.m., 7 p.m. and 8:30 p.m from 31 October to 21 November.
In this show, the façade of the oldest building of the University of Geneva will be illuminated and animated to the rhythm of colourful paintings that evoke the beauty of mathematics.
The public lecture “Does randomness really exist?” will take place on 2 November at 6:30 p.m.
Hugo Duminil Copin, Professor of mathematics at the University of Geneva and the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques, will discuss the extent to which seemingly random events are in fact deterministic.
This talk is a last addition to the series of conferences on the theme of mathematics in the 2020 Colloquium.
The public lecture will be webcast and accessible on the Colloquium’s website.
Access to the public talk on campus and online is free of charge after online registration on the University of Geneva website.
The conference is in French with simultaneous English translation.
Entering a new chapter for the HL-LHC project.
More than 200 participants gathered online at the 11th annual HL-LHC collaboration meeting to take stock of CERN’s flagship project as it starts taking shape on an industrial scale.
The High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), CERN’s current flagship project, is the highest-priority project of the recent update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics.
The project aims for a tenfold increase in the integrated luminosity and an extension of the LHC’s lifetime well beyond the mid-2030s.
Therefore, it relies on resources and expertise from laboratories and teams worldwide – from America to Japan, from China to Italy – whose members join up every year with the CERN experts to take stock of the advancement of the project and find common solutions to the challenges ahead.
The latest of these collaboration meetings ended on 22 October after four days of online plenary and parallel sessions.
More than 200 collaborators from around the world joined the talks, which were held virtually due to the travel restrictions that are still being imposed in many countries due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We only held plenary sessions last year while this year, for the first time, we also organised remote parallel sessions in which smaller groups of collaborators had the opportunity to meet and discuss detailed technical issues in different areas.
This arrangement made for a dense and intense programme, but it was a pleasant surprise how smoothly it went.
The initial timidity in the virtual coffee rooms quickly dissipated and led to enthusiastic and productive discussions between our collaborators.
The meeting of the Collaboration Board, the steering body of the HL-LHC project, which synchronises work between the various institutes, was also held in a virtual format, allowing participants to discuss the high-level stakes at hand, against the backdrop of a transition phase for the project.
The R&D efforts for many of the HL-LHC’s cutting-edge components, designed to prepare the accelerator for a sharp increase in the number of collisions, have been finalised in many areas and are making way for the production of components through industrial partnerships, as was also reported in the latest edition of the annual Collaboration Board newsletter.
Among the many impressive achievements reported during the meeting, our members learned about the latest test results of a whole range of new magnets developed specifically for the project, including AUP’s (the Accelerator Upgrade Programme) Nb3Sn triplet quadrupoles, four of which have already been built and fully qualified for operation to date.
Another highlight was the achievement of nominal performance of the innovative nested-coil corrector magnets, which gave the green light to start their industrial production at Elytt Energy, in Spain, with the support of CIEMAT.
Japan and Italy are both currently shipping prototypes of separation and recombination dipoles to CERN for final validation at cold, and the UK collaboration is starting to assemble the first cryomodule with crab cavities recently delivered by CERN.
CERN has also received the first superconducting link cables and cryostats from industry, underlining the transition from prototyping to series production for the project.
The transition to this new chapter for the project was celebrated, along with the progress of the civil engineering works, both for surface buildings and for the new underground caverns housing the equipment for the accelerator upgrade, a cornerstone of the project that needed to be finalised during LS2.
We look forward to inviting our collaborators to visit these new structures at Point 1 and see the full extent of the progress on the occasion of a future in-person meeting at CERN.
In the short term, the global health situation permitting, next year’s meeting will likely be hosted by Uppsala University in Sweden, which recently built the pioneering FREIA laboratory to contribute to the testing of HL-LHC magnets and cavities.

Bringing new life to ATLAS data.
The updated version of the ATLAS analysis software will reprocess all ATLAS collision data from Run 2 over the coming months
The ATLAS collaboration is breathing new life into its LHC Run 2 dataset, recorded from 2015 to 2018.
Physicists will be reprocessing the entire dataset – nearly 18 PB of collision data – using an updated version of the ATLAS offline analysis software (Athena).
Not only will this improve ATLAS physics measurements and searches, it will also position the collaboration well for the upcoming challenges of Run 3 and beyond.
Athena converts raw signals recorded by the ATLAS experiment into more simplified datasets for physicists to study.
Its new-and-improved version has been in development for several years and includes multi-threading capabilities, more complex physics-analysis functions and improved memory consumption.
“Our aim was to significantly reduce the amount of memory needed to run the software, widen the types of physics analyses it could do and – most critically – allow current and future ATLAS datasets to be analysed together,” says Zach Marshall, ATLAS Computing Coordinator.
“These improvements are a key part of our preparations for future high-intensity operations of the LHC – in particular the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run beginning around 2028, which will see ATLAS’s computing resources in extremely high demand.”
This latest version of Athena already makes good headway in reducing the computing resources required for data analysis.
For example, the computationally intensive job of taking individual signals from the inner detector and chaining them together to form particle tracks is now two to four times faster.
Less disk space is needed to store the results and overall the software runs more smoothly.
The software improvements also feature new ways for physicists to study their data.
For example, researchers will now, by default, be able to look for tracks that originate away from the collision point.
These could be signatures of particles with long lifetimes and may lead to evidence of exciting beyond-the-Standard-Model physics processes.
While such searches were possible with the earlier version of the ATLAS software, the heavy computing resources they required meant they could not always be carried out.
Finally, physicists have also made improvements to the databases containing all of the time-dependent status information of the detector components.
These databases – on which Athena runs – now incorporate an improved understanding of the detector’s operation during Run 2.  “Every data-taking period is an opportunity for us to learn more about the detector and its subsystems,” says Song-Ming Wang, ATLAS Data Preparation Coordinator.  “Revisiting these databases with the benefit of hindsight will allow us to provide even better performance.”
With the new Athena software now up and running, researchers have set out to reprocess the entire Run 2 dataset.
This will take several months, as the dataset is quite substantial.
The expected results will be well worth this effort: ATLAS will have a significantly improved dataset that will allow for crisper measurements, more powerful searches and simpler combinations of past and future data.  Read the original article on the ATLAS website.
Call for volunteers to take part in a realistic emergency response exercise at CMS.
The exercise, organised by the CERN Fire and Rescue service in collaboration with the French and Swiss emergency services, will take place at CMS on 13 November
After the success of the emergency response exercise at the Globe in 2019, which took place in collaboration with the emergency services of CERN’s Host States, the CERN Fire and Rescue service is organising another exercise – on 13 November, at Point 5 of the LHC.
This large-scale exercise was originally planned for 2020 but was postponed because of the health crisis.  Its purpose is to enhance interoperability and communication between the various emergency response teams and to improve knowledge and understanding of their respective working methods when implementing a multinational response to a major incident.
As part of the exercise, several sub-scenarios will be staged at Point 5 – on the surface, in the CMS technical cavern and in the HiLumi underground areas.
Volunteers from the CERN community will be needed to make the exercise a success.
They will be assigned to teams with specific tasks, according to their skillset.
If you match one of the profiles outlined below and you would like to volunteer to take part in the exercise, you can sign up on the Indico page, specifying which team you would like to join and your profile.
Please bear in mind that, depending on requirements, not all applicants may be chosen.
Four categories of volunteer have been identified:
Safety personnel: You know CERN’s infrastructure well, are capable of identifying dangerous situations and know how to handle them by guiding people to safety.
Ideally, your everyday work is in safety and you are accredited to work underground.
Technical correspondents: You are very familiar with CERN’s activities and in particular those of CMS.
As part of the exercise, you must be able to respond in French to the questions asked by the partner emergency services about the site – whether about the surface facilities or the underground installations.
Actors: You play the role of visitors and/or the injured.
No particular skills are required, but some visitors will need to be accredited to go down into the CMS and HiLumi technical cavern.
Exercise supervisors: You are capable of supervising, coordinating, guiding, speeding up and slowing down the various sub-scenarios under the supervision of the exercise leader.
You are also accredited to go down into the CMS and HiLumi technical cavern.
Apply to take part via Indico by 3 November.

CERN’s EU Projects Office announces a relaunch of its newsletter starting in November 2021
Starting in November 2021, the “EU Projects @ CERN” newsletter will provide readers with a quarterly digest of news about European projects in which CERN is involved.
Each issue will focus on a specific topic related to European projects: the creation of project consortia, the search for suitable funding, etc.
The newsletter will not only provide information on EU support services and resources at CERN, but also particulars on deadlines and funding opportunities, such as open or upcoming calls for proposals of potential interest to CERN.
“With the revamped publication of our newsletter, we aim to display the diversity of European projects at CERN and to further encourage CERN teams to participate in the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation,” explains Svetlomir Stavrev, Section Leader for EU Project Management and Operational Support.  “The newsletter will also show how European projects contribute to the R&D programmes and objectives of the Organization.”
CERN’s long-standing cooperation with the European Commission is based on a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the two parties in 2009, and on the very successful participation of CERN in the EU Framework Programmes for Research and Innovation (100 projects in FP7 and 110 projects in H2020).

Seven local students shared their scientific projects against the clock.
On Friday, 15 October 2021, seven students from Geneva and the Pays de Gex presented their high-school graduation projects as part of the cross-border scientific colloquium Partage ta science at CERN’s Globe of Science and Innovation
Formerly known as “Mon TPE/TM en 15 minutes”, the colloquium – presented by and for young people – was renamed “Partage ta science” this year.
The event format was also changed to adapt to the new French curriculum and allow students pursuing vocational training in Geneva to take part.
For this tenth consecutive edition, four high-school students from the Pays de Gex each had five minutes to make a presentation for their new oral exam – the grand oral, while three high-school students from Geneva each had 15 minutes to present their travail de maturité or travail personnel d’approfondissement.
The presentations covered a wide range of subjects, from antibiotic resistance to dark matter, via the engineer Henri Pitot and sound waves.
Some particularly topical matters were also addressed, such as artificial intelligence and the mathematical modelling of an epidemic.
Cartoonist Barrigue, the founder of the magazine Vigousse and of the association CrayonSolidaires, dessiner pour tous, was once again on hand to liven up the proceedings. He entertained the audience by drawing some quirky and occasionally provocative live reactions to the presentations.
You can find videos of the presentations and photos of the evening on the event website.
The four LHC experiments are getting ready for pilot beams.
After over two years of upgrades and maintenance works, the four main LHC experiments are finalising preparations to receive pilot beams
Update: The first pilot beams circulated in the LHC on 19 October 2021.
On 26 October, there were low-intensity test collisions at an injection energy of 450 GeV per beam and stable collisions of proton beams were declared on the morning of 27 October.
Since 2019, many places at CERN have been operating like beehives to complete the scheduled upgrades for the second long shutdown (LS2) of the accelerator complex.
This period of intense work is now coming to an end with the injection of the first pilot beams into the LHC.
This major milestone will be featured during a live event on CERN’s social media channels on 20 October at 4 pm (CEST).
The pilot beams are part of the commissioning of the LHC machine in preparation for its Run 3, starting in 2022.
With an integrated luminosity equal to the two previous runs combined, the four LHC experiments will be able to perform even more precise measurements.
Yet, to stay apace with the accelerator’s improved vigour, all of them had to undergo a series of upgrades and transformations.
After the refurbished Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and the revamped Miniframe joined the ALICE detector in the cavern, the reinstallation of its new Muon Forward Tracker subdetector followed.
In May, a new Inner Tracking System (ITS), the largest pixel detector ever built, took the seat of the previous one, between the beam pipe and the TPC.
The final piece of the ALICE puzzle – the Fast Interaction Trigger (FIT) – was installed in July.
At ATLAS, among the ongoing works, the muon spectrometer was upgraded, notably with the installation of one of the two New Small Wheels, which uses new technologies such as the novel small-strip Thin Gap Chambers (sTGC) and the Micromegas detectors.
Its twin will be lowered into the detector’s cavern in November.
In 2020, the CMS experiment completed the installation of the first GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier) station, the brand new sub-detector system for detecting muons in the region closest to the beam pipe.
This year, a new, redesigned beam pipe with a new vacuum pumping group was installed.
Over the summer, after its design was improved and its innermost layer replaced, the Pixel Tracker was installed at the centre of the CMS detector, followed by the Beam Radiation, Instrumentation and Luminosity (BRIL) sub-detectors.
As for the LHCb experiment, an important metamorphosis happened during these two years.
A new scintillating-fibre particle-tracking detector (SciFi) and upgraded ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors, RICH1 and RICH2, were installed this year, before the recommissioning of the beam pipe.
The installation of a faster Vertex Locator (VELO) is planned for the coming months.
The first proton beams circulated in CERN’s accelerator chain in December last year, with the first beam being injected into the PS Booster (PSB), connecting it for the first time to the new Linac4.
The Proton Synchrotron followed, accelerating its first beam in March, while the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) saw its first beams accelerated in May.
CERN celebrates the 2021 "Fête de la science" in Ferney-Voltaire and Annecy-le-Vieux.
Over the weekend of 9 and 10 October, CERN scientists engaged with the public in Ferney-Voltaire and Annecy-le-Vieux, sharing their knowledge and imparting their passion for science on the theme “Eurêka ! émotion de la découverte”
About 1000 visitors took part in the fun and games at the Village des sciences in Ferney-Voltaire and 400 in Annecy-le-Vieux.
CERN was the guest of honour for the 30th anniversary of the Fête de la science, alongside entrepreneurs and associations like Pangloss Labs, and other scientific institutions including the Annecy Particle Physics Laboratory (LAPP), the Theoretical Physics Laboratory of Annecy-le-Vieux (LAPTh), the EUTOPIA platform and the Ecole Polytech.
This was the third time CERN had taken part in such events in Ferney-Voltaire and the first time in Annecy-le-Vieux.
In Ferney-Voltaire, the five activities organised by CERN were a hit.
In the gardens of the Château de Voltaire, the youngest visitors went on a treasure hunt to find routers and re-enact the internet browsing process.
They also learned how to make pictures using pixels and got to grips with the basic principles of an electronic circuit through their own artistic creations.  But the most popular attractions by far were the particle detection show and the interactive game.
Visitors became detectives for a day, seeking clues to identify particles and learning about how particle detectors work.
In addition, an evening event to celebrate the birth of the World Wide Web was held on Wednesday, 6 October, with a special appearance by one of the internet’s pioneers in Europe, François Fluckiger, which attracted an audience of around fifty.
In Annecy-le-Vieux, visitors of all ages were thrilled to meet scientists working at LAPP and take part in the CERN activities on offer.
The organisers of S’Cool LAB presented their “Salad Bowl Accelerator”, a simple and fun way of demonstrating how a particle accelerator works.
In a similar vein, an exhibition called “Accélérer le futur” showcased the technological advances that could be applied to future accelerators like the one currently on the drawing board, the Future Circular Collider.
Many went away happily clutching their souvenirs, such as a photo of themselves in front of the Large Hadron Collider or a badge depicting the elementary particle best matching their personality.
Many thanks to everyone who made both events possible and ensured that fun was had by all, in full compliance with the health and safety measures in force.  Thanks also to the CERN volunteers who gave up their free time and were perfect ambassadors of the Organization.
There’s nothing more to say than... roll on next year!
Successful beam pipe installation at LHCb.
The beam pipe was reinstalled in the LHCb detector over the summer, marking a new milestone in the experiment’s upgrade
The LHC experiments are nearing the completion of maintenance and upgrade works carried out in the framework of the second long shutdown of CERN’s accelerator complex.
Of all the experiments, LHCb is undergoing the most significant metamorphosis during these two years, namely the installation of a faster Vertex Locator (VELO), a new scintillating-fibre particle-tracking detector (SciFi), and upgraded ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors, RICH1 and RICH2.
While the installation of LHCb’s subdetectors and infrastructure in preparation for commissioning is still under way, its beampipe was successfully reinstalled over the summer, marking a milestone in the detector’s preparation for Run 3 of the LHC.
The LHCb beam pipe has a conical shape through the whole of the LHCb detector, which makes it different from that of the other experiments.
Along its total length of 19 m, its diameter ranges from 50 mm close to the LHCb interaction point to 380 mm in the experiment’s muon system.
The beam pipe is composed of four sections, all of different lengths.
Three of these sections are made of beryllium and measure 11.6 m, giving LHCb the longest beryllium beam pipe of all the LHC experiments.
The last and biggest section is made of stainless steel.
Both the shape and material of the beam pipe were chosen to optimise its transparency to particles emerging from the collisions that take place at the LHC.
The beam pipe has a spider-web-like support structure in the aperture of the LHCb magnet, with beryllium collars and carbon-fibre ropes and rods ensuring that the amount of material is kept to a minimum.
Installed during the first long shutdown, it was the first such structure ever used in an experiment and remains unique in the world today.
The support structure may seem fragile, but is able to keep the beam pipe in place under the huge force that it exerts on itself when under vacuum.
The installation of the LHCb beam pipe, which involved engineers and technicians across multiple departments, started in April.
The first smaller section was inserted through the RICH1 subdetector and connected to the VELO vacuum tank surrounding the interaction point.
The installation and careful alignment of the spider-web-like structure followed in mid-July.
The remaining sections were installed afterwards in a well-defined order: first, the longest (7 m) beryllium section was slid through the inner cylindrical sheath of the RICH2 subdetector.
Then, the stainless-steel cone, the heaviest (160 kg) and biggest section, was lifted up to the beamline with a crane and then slid into place in the centre of the muon system.
Finally, the lightest beryllium section (about 4 kg) was carefully installed by hand, sliding it into place on its spider-web support in the magnet.
Once the sections had been connected with bellows and checks had been carried out to make sure that there were no leaks in the connections, the bake-out procedure to improve the quality of the vacuum started in mid-August.
For this step, the beam pipe was wrapped in heating blankets, allowing it to be heated up to 250 °C. The VELO vacuum tank and the very thin radio-frequency foil that separates the LHCb detector vacuum from the LHC beam vacuum were also heated at the same time as the beam pipe.
After final checks of the vacuum quality, the heating blankets were removed and the beam pipe was filled with neon gas at atmospheric pressure to keep it ready for beams to circulate in October.

Science Gateway: Night-time traffic disruptions expected from 25 October to 2 November on the Route de Meyrin.
Two new architectural features, a bridge and a second tubular structure, will soon be incorporated into the Science Gateway architectural complex
Science Gateway, CERN’s new flagship centre for science education and outreach designed by the Renzo Piano Building Workshop and brodbeck roulet architectes associés, continues to take shape.
The first tube structure was installed in August 2021 next to the Esplanade des Particules.
Its tubular twin will be erected on 22 October on the other side of the road, causing no traffic disruptions.
The two steel cylinders, measuring 10 metres in diameter and 85 and 67 metres in length, evoke the underground tunnels of the LHC.
They will house CERN’s permanent and temporary exhibitions, where people of all ages will have the chance to find out about CERN’s discoveries.
The tubular structures will be connected by a bridge sitting 6 metres above the Route de Meyrin.
The installation of the bridge will take place between 25 October and 2 November 2021.
To minimise traffic disruptions, this structure will be erected during the night from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m.  The nights concerned are 25–26, 26–27 and 27–28 October and 1–2 November.
Motor vehicle traffic will be diverted through Rue Germaine Tillion (D35), crossing the communes of Prévessin-Moëns and Ferney-Voltaire in France and the town of Meyrin in Switzerland, via the Avenue Auguste-François-Dubois.
These disruptions will not affect cyclists, pedestrians or public transport (stops along lines 18 and 68 will be accessible at all times, except from 1 a.m. to 4.40 a.m.).
Traffic officers will be present throughout the duration of the works.
Although everything is being done to limit the negative impact of these works, some unavoidable inconveniences may remain.
CERN thanks residents for their understanding and recommends that drivers exercise caution and comply with road signage.
The architectural complex will include two striking features contributing to environmental sustainability: solar panels and a forest.
Up to 1860 solar panels will be installed on the three pavilions that will house a large 900-seat amphitheatre, education labs, an exhibition, the reception area and the restaurant.
The forest, with more than 400 trees, will provide a nature-filled experience for people exploring the area on foot.
Science Gateway is due to open to the public in 2023.
Winter tyres mandatory in France from 1 November.
From 1 November 2021 until 31 March 2022, several French départements, including Ain and Haute-Savoie, will require cars to be equipped with winter tyres or to have snow chains in the boot.
The aim of the new regulation is to enhance road safety by reducing the risks associated with driving on snowy or icy roads.
It will also help to avoid traffic congestion in mountainous regions, where unequipped vehicles can slide and block lanes, thereby immobilising entire traffic axes.
Breaches of the new regulation will be tolerated this winter and penalised as of next, but everyone is strongly encouraged to comply.
More information on the regulation can be found on the French road safety agency’s website (French only).
A full list of the départements and municipalities concerned can be found here.
CERN Quantum Technology Initiative unveils strategic roadmap shaping CERN’s role in next quantum revolution.
CERN QTI reaches its next milestone today, with the unveiling of a first roadmap defining its medium- and long-term quantum research programme
Geneva, 14 October 2021.
The CERN Quantum Technology Initiative (CERN QTI) reaches its next milestone today, with the unveiling of a first roadmap defining its medium- and long-term quantum research programme.
The roadmap details the CERN QTI goals and strategy, and outlines its governing structure and the composition of its international advisory board, as well as the activities to support the exchange of knowledge and innovation with the high-energy physics community and beyond in the extensive field of quantum technologies.
Through CERN QTI, CERN is disseminating its enabling technologies – such as quantum state sensors, time synchronisation protocols, and many more from the cryogenics, electronics, quantum theory and computing domains – to accelerate the development of quantum technologies.
Today’s information and communication technology grew out of the knowledge and development of quantum mechanics during the last century.
CERN QTI will see the CERN community play their part in a global effort to bring about the “next quantum revolution” – whereby counterintuitive phenomena such as superposition and entanglement are exploited to build novel computing, communication, and sensing and simulation devices.
“As an international, open and neutral platform, and building on its collaborative culture and proven track record of innovation, CERN is uniquely positioned to act as an “honest broker” between CERN Member States and to foster innovative ideas in the field of high-energy physics and beyond,” says Professor Joachim Mnich, CERN Director for Research and Computing.  “This is underpinned by several concrete R&D projects that are already under way at CERN.”
Composed of prominent international experts nominated by the 23 CERN Member States, the recently formed advisory board contributed to the roadmap being published today.
“The roadmap builds on high-quality research projects already ongoing at CERN, with top-level collaborations, to advance a vision and concrete steps to explore the potential of quantum information science and technologies for high-energy physics,” reported Kerstin Borras and Yasser Omar, co-chairs of the CERN QTI advisory board, in a statement unanimously approved by the board members.
“CERN can play a key role as a facilitator of cross-disciplinary discussions about the role of quantum technologies in science, advancing the development of use cases and enabling technologies, promoting co-development, as well as being a key early-adopter of quantum technologies.
The members of the advisory board will promote the collaboration between the quantum technologies and the high-energy physics communities in their respective countries, with CERN and its roadmap being a very important forum and instrument to develop fruitful cross-fertilisation.”
The board will work together with the CERN QTI management team to guide the activities and create as many synergies as possible with national and international initiatives related to quantum technologies.
A year on from its launch, CERN QTI has already established collaborations and projects to explore how quantum technologies can best benefit high-energy physics and beyond in four main quantum research areas: quantum computing and algorithms; quantum theory and simulation; quantum sensing, metrology and materials; and quantum communication and networks.
The current projects span multiple research topics and target applications such as quantum graph neural networks for track reconstruction, quantum support vector machines for particle classification, quantum anomaly detection for beyond the Standard Model searches, quantum generative adversarial networks for physics simulation, new sensors and materials for future detectors, and secure quantum key distribution protocols for distributed data analysis.
Education and training are also at the core of CERN QTI.
Building on the success of its first online course on quantum computing, CERN QTI will be extending its academia–industry training programme to accelerate the process of cultivating competencies across various R&D and engineering activities for the new generation of scientists, from high-school students to senior researchers.
“CERN has demonstrated excellence in scientific research for many years, and has fostered great innovation in computing technologies.
Building on its unique expertise and strong collaborative culture, CERN is in a distinctive position today to foster quantum developments in the European high-energy physics community and beyond,” concludes Alberto Di Meglio, Coordinator of the CERN Quantum Technology Initiative.
About CERN QTI
The CERN Quantum Technology Initiative (CERN QTI) is a comprehensive R&D, academic and knowledge-sharing initiative to exploit quantum advantage for high-energy physics and beyond.
Given CERN's increasing information and communications technology and computing demands, as well as the significant national and international interest in quantum-technology activities, CERN QTI aims to provide dedicated mechanisms for the exchange of both knowledge and innovation.

Computer Security: Beauty under the hood.
CERN hosts hundreds of web servers, thousands of websites and more than a million webpages.
Most of them work and have a well-defined purpose, many are sleek and well done, modern or fancy, some are a bit 90s style, and some are outdated or obsolete.
While the aesthetics can be discussed, disputed and depend strongly on subjective tastes, there are certain ground rules that all web servers, websites and webpages should follow – not on the surface but more “under the hood”.
Some beauty is also appreciated there.
So, to all you webmasters here at CERN, think of your favourite webpage that you manage and maintain.
Does your webpage’s name make sense and is it sufficiently short and meaningful?
What if I use the associated IP address instead – do I get the same content?
And if I browse to a subpage, any subpage, do I get some meaningful content even if I misspelled the full URL (the webpage’s full path)?
Does your webpage catch errors appropriately and redirect accordingly (e.g. no pages that don’t exist, requiring authentication or where access is plainly forbidden)?
What about certificate errors?  Or any other error or debugging message?
Do you redirect to HTTPS, in particular when hosting sensitive and access-protected content?
If you answered “no”, “don’t know”, “dunno”, “???”, or if you shrug, facepalm or twitch, the time has come to check!
Make sure that you have a proper landing page or, if you don’t think that you can have one, make sure that you redirect to, e.g., cern.ch.
Configure the standard 401, 403 and 404 error messages in order to avoid disclosing error or debug information.
If your page runs JavaScript, PHP or any other web content management software, catch any other error messages and make sure that they are not displayed to the end user.
Similarly, remove all default information like Apache default pages or Tomcat default webapps, webinfo pages and other modules and options that are not necessary to provide the intended content.
Redirect from HTTP (port 80/tcp) to HTTPS (port 443/tcp) to make sure that confidentiality and integrity are preserved.
Make sure that the server doesn’t support outdated encryption protocols like SSL or TLS versions older than version 1.2.  Make sure that the site’s certificate is valid, trusted and not expired.
And don’t forget the software running on the server.  It should be developed with care and work with the server settings providing the required security features, like proper logging and error handling.
While overlooking any of these settings is not security-critical by itself, attackers might still get the impression that the overall set up is sub-optimal or mediocre and decide it’s worth poking deeper (see our article on a “Digital Broken Windows Theory”.
It also shows a lack of professionalism and puts CERN in a bad light.
Hence, check your web server, website or webpage once more, and pimp it up.  Fix those issues.
Beautify it, also under the hood.  Take advantage of external guidance.
For example, CIS offers free benchmarks to harden not only the underlying operating system, but also several web server software and versions.
Qualys SSL Labs provides a few SSL/TLS configuration analyses.
And you can also check out the OWASP cheat sheet series for more specific hands-on guidance on web development.
Finally, have a look, too, at our more general recommendations for software developers and webmasters.
Or, as always, reach out to us for help or advice or to request an independent look and security check:

Katy Foraz’s message to the CERN community.
A new department head, Katy Foraz (Engineering – EN) introduces herself to the CERN community in a video interview
2021 marked the start of a new mandate for the management team at the helm of the Organization.
In this new video series, the newly appointed department heads introduce themselves to our community, tell us about their journeys and provide their vision for the future of their departments.
Katy Foraz, the new Head of the Engineering department, continues this series with her message (below).
Katy is a trained engineer who has been part of our community for twenty-eight years.
With a background in aeronautical engineering, she has been involved in LHC-related activities since 1993, first as a junior project engineer until becoming section leader and now head of department.
This video was recorded on 07 October.
Helmut Weber (1947 – 2021).
Helmut Weber, CERN Director of Administration from 1992 to 1994, passed away on 16 July.
Born in 1947, he obtained his PhD from the University of Vienna, after which he pursued a high-flying career in the aerospace industry, where he acquired considerable managerial experience.
Prior to joining CERN, Helmut had been chair of the board of directors of Skyline Products (US) and a member of the board of directors of the ERC (European Refurbishment Centre) in Paris.
Helmut played a significant role during CERN’s transition from the LEP era to the LHC project.
During his three-year appointment, as successor to Georges Vianès and predecessor to Maurice Robin, he succeeded in implementing many necessary improvements to the CERN administration.
Examples include the reorganisation of the finance division (split into the procurement and accounting divisions) and the creation of a CERN-wide working group to standardise administrative procedures using a common online database.
He also resolved a number of looming issues carried forward from the LEP era, such as the debt to the CERN Pension Fund and the financial claims made by the Euro–LEP consortium.
Furthermore, together with Meinhard Regler and with the active support of CERN (including Kurt Hübner and Philip Bryant), Helmut promoted AUSTRON, a project proposal for a pulsed high-flux neutron spallation source as an international research centre for Central Europe.
Although this project could unfortunately not be realised due to lack of funding, the MedAustron facility for proton/ion therapy and research was eventually built as an alternative, a successful example of technology transfer from elementary particle physics to medical applications.
Helmut Weber’s most important legacy, however, is his straightforward, uncompromising and honest character that helped to resolve many contentious internal issues at CERN.
By the time he left the Organization, he had made many friends amongst his former colleagues, who will always remember him fondly and miss him.
His friends and former colleagues
Egil Lillestøl (1938 – 2021).
Norwegian experimental particle physicist Egil Sigurd Lillestøl passed away in Valence, France, on 27 September.
He will be remembered as a passionate colleague with exceptional communication and teaching skills, and a friend with many personal interests.
He was able to explain the most complex systems and mechanisms in physics so that even the layperson felt they understood them.
Egil Lillestøl obtained his PhD from the University of Bergen in 1970, by which time he had already spent three years (1964–1967) as a fellow at CERN.
He was appointed associate professor at his alma mater the same year, and then left for Paris in 1973 where he was a guest researcher at the Collège de France.
In 1984, Lillestøl was appointed full professor in experimental particle physics in Bergen, where he became central in the PLUTO collaboration at DESY, DELPHI and then ATLAS at CERN.
Over time, CERN became Lillestøl’s main laboratory, first as a paid associate, later as a guest professor and eventually as a staff member, contributing to the management of the experimental programme and significantly improving the conditions for the visiting scientists at the Laboratory.
In Norway, he acted as national coordinator of CERN activities in preparation for the LHC.
He was instrumental in the organisation of the community and discussions of future funding models at the national level, in particular to accommodate the long-term commitments needed for the ATLAS and ALICE construction projects.
Egil Lillestøl played a pivotal role in the CERN Schools of Physics from 1992 until 2009, relaunching the European School of High-Energy Physics as annual events organised in collaboration with JINR, and establishing a new biennial series of schools in Latin America from 2001.
He worked tirelessly on preparations for each event, in collaboration with local organisers in each host country, as well as on site during the two-week-long events.
The Latin American schools were an important factor in increasing the involvement of scientists and institutes from the region in the CERN experimental programme, for which he deserves much credit.
Beyond his official duties, he took great pleasure in interacting with the participants of the schools during their free time, and in the evenings he could often be found playing piano to accompany their singing.
As a founding member of the International Thorium Energy Committee, Lillestøl was a strong proponent of thorium-based nuclear power.
He was also one of the main drivers behind the UNESCO-supported travelling exhibition “Science bringing nations together”, organised jointly by JINR and CERN.
As a teacher and a lecturer, Lillestøl was a role model.
He always tailored his presentations to match the audience.
His tabletop book, The Search for Infinity, co-authored with Gordon Fraser and Inge Sellevåg, became a bestseller and has been published in nine language editions.
Egil Lillestøl was a bon viveur who spread joy around him.
He had an impressive repertoire of anecdotes, including on topics such as how to cold-smoke salmon.
He enjoyed sports and was active in the CERN clubs for cycling, skiing and sailing.
He leaves behind his wife and former colleague, Danielle, and two adult children from his first marriage.

Watch the renovation of CERN’s East Area.
With the upgrade works now over, the experiments in the East Area are taking physics measurements again – time for a rewind
CERN’s East Area has hosted a variety of fixed-target experiments since the 1950s, using four beamlines from the Proton Synchrotron (PS).
Over the past two years, the experimental area – CERN’s second largest – has undergone a complete makeover.
New instrumentation and beamline configuration have improved the precision of data collection, and new magnets and power convertors have drastically reduced the area’s energy consumption.
As the beams return to the accelerator complex, the East Area’s experiments are taking physics measurements again and the facility’s central role in the modern physics landscape has been restored.
Watch a time-lapse video condensing two years of the East Area renovations into two minutes below.

Environmental awareness: Mitigation of environmental noise from CERN’s installations.
Reducing environmental noise: Not just loud words
Like other industrial plants, the infrastructure needed to operate CERN’s large accelerators emits noise, especially when the accelerators are operational or undergoing maintenance.
The main sources of noise at CERN are cryogenic installations, transformers, compressors, pumps, cooling towers and HVAC systems.
In 2019, the Laboratory adopted an environmental noise reduction policy.
The corresponding implementation strategy was agreed upon with the competent local authorities.
This policy was established taking, as a baseline, the noise generated in 2018 by CERN’s installations.
It also sets out both preventive and corrective measures to avoid exceeding the existing noise levels.
Since the baseline was defined, CERN has carried out yearly noise measurement campaigns in the vicinity of some 120 locations, during both daytime and night-time, to verify that the noise levels remain within the limits set.
As part of implementing CERN’s environmental noise policy, a project called NuiSoCERN has been launched in collaboration with HEPIA in Geneva (Haute école du paysage, d’ingénierie et d’architecture de Genève).
The project involves developing 3D acoustic models for each CERN site in order to study potential improvements and plan for the future.
For this purpose, sources of noise, such as existing noisy infrastructure and equipment, are characterised, based on the ISO 9614-3 standard.
The noise source data is then processed by a 3D georeferenced modelling software, CadnaA, which computes CERN’s environmental noise footprint with respect to the nearest residential areas.
Mitigation measures are defined where needed, based on the results of the modelling.
Priority is given to reducing the noise at the source, for example by modifying the installations or replacing noisy equipment with quieter equipment.
Patrols are also organised to detect malfunctioning equipment early.
Should it prove impossible to make the modification for technical reasons, CERN instead implements mitigation measures, such as noise barriers and silencers.
An example of this is the installation of two large noise silencers on the cryogenic exhaust at LHC Point 2 in 2020 prior to the start of the cool-down of the accelerator.
The efficiency of these measures was confirmed by continuously measuring noise levels during the entire cool-down campaign.
Similarly, acoustic screening solutions have been implemented on the outlet ventilations of the new data centres located at LHC Point 8 (see below).
For information on occupational noise, please consult the General Safety Instruction for protection of workers against noise (GSI-SH-4).
This article is a part of the series “CERN’s Year of Environmental Awareness”.
CERN celebrates alumni impact at global online reunion.
The “Second Collisions” alumni reunion was held using a virtual recreation of CERN
CERN alumni from across the globe united from 1 to 3 October for a major online reunion.  The event was held within a digital recreation of the CERN site.
Over 1000 people from 80 countries registered for the event, whose full title was “CERN Alumni Second Collisions: Research Matters”.
The event featured a range of exciting talks from fascinating speakers, including addresses from CERN Director-Generals past and present and an in-depth presentation of Science Gateway.
There were presentations from CERN alumni on vaccine-transport technologies, treating cancer with particle beams, space exploration, thorium nuclear reactors, quantum-computing technologies, autonomous supply chains, tackling Parkinson’s disease, and more.
Attendees were also treated to a special presentation on the captivating process undertaken by the visual-effects company DNEG, in collaboration with Nobel-Prize-winning physicist Kip Thorne, to create the special effects for the blockbuster film Interstellar.
The event featured a range of other activities as well, including a CERN-themed virtual escape game and an opportunity to meet members of CERN’s Management.
On top of this, there were many opportunities to network or simply to catch up with old friends from the Laboratory.
And there were virtual booths where attendees could learn about interesting CERN projects and exciting start-up companies, and discover new career opportunities.
“It was a great event,” says Nadine Weber, a former external member of the Alpha collaboration.
“Thank you for providing us with these amazing opportunities to connect!  I loved the talks and the networking opportunities – and especially the virtual platform!
I really enjoyed participating!”
“I was thrilled to be at CERN again, albeit virtually,” says Alessandro Pasta, general manager at Diagramma SRL, who formerly worked at the DELPHI experiment.  “Thank you for organising the Second Collisions event; the organising team did an amazing job!”
At the event, special prizes were awarded to CERN alumni who have had a significant positive impact on society.
Awardees included people now working in teaching, climate-change research, public health and even science journalism.
“In the many different fields where CERN alumni contribute, they are all ambassadors for science, for a more science-literate society and for the values of science,” says Charlotte Warakaulle, CERN Director for International Relations, who also addressed attendees at the event.  “The alumni network allows them to stay connected with CERN and with each other, maintaining the connection with the world of fundamental research that has helped to shape their professional trajectories.”
The event was the first major alumni reunion since the “First Collisions” event of early 2018.
Since its launch in 2017, the CERN alumni network has gone from strength to strength: its rapid growth has seen the community reach over 7250 members today.
The network offers members access to the latest news about CERN, tailored career opportunities and an easy way to keep in touch with friends from the Organization.
The CERN Alumni team arranges thematic career events providing useful insights and guidance to those moving out of academia, as well as organising major reunion events like this one.
“The participants at “Second Collisions” reported that they were delighted to come back to CERN virtually,” says Rachel Bray, Head of the CERN Alumni Programme.
“The combination of the platform, inspirational talks and networking has renewed their connection with CERN and their enthusiasm for the network.
We’re all looking forward to “Third Collisions”, which we hope will be in person and at Science Gateway in 2024.”
CERN working with WHO to improve understanding of COVID-19 airborne transmission risk in indoor spaces.
As the response to the pandemic evolves and people step back into the office, it is necessary to monitor continuously the risk of disease transmission and be prepared to make quick, evidence-based decisions to ensure that everyone can work safely.
CERN has developed the COVID Airborne Risk Assessment tool (CARA) to help personnel return to work safely by assessing the risk of COVID-19 infection in enclosed spaces like offices or meeting rooms.
In accordance with CERN’s knowledge-transfer strategy, CERN has made the CARA software open-source, and the tool is freely available to all on GitLab.
The tool has attracted the attention of many international organisations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Office at Geneva (UNOG).
In June 2021, CERN shared its approach to risk assessment of occupational hazards, presenting CARA to WHO’s COVID Expert Panel.
As a result, WHO has now invited CERN to become a member of a multidisciplinary working group of international experts, which will work to define a standardised algorithm to quantify airborne transmission risk in indoor settings.
The collaboration takes place within CERN’s wide-ranging engagement with other international organisations, promoting shared solutions to societal challenges.
“Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO has worked closely with a wide range of experts from diverse technical disciplines and organisations on gathering evidence, developing and updating guidance, including on the research on modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and related infection prevention and control recommendations.
The CARA tool developed by CERN is an innovative approach to estimating the risk and informing space-management decisions for a safe return to work,” says Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO COVID-19 Technical Lead.
“With the expertise and competence of medical and health professionals from the WHO worldwide community, it could eventually be possible to harness CERN’s CARA tool for wider applications that benefit society,” says Archana Sharma, Senior Adviser for Relations with International Organisations, who coordinates CERN’s relations with WHO.
The CARA tool models the concentration profile of potential airborne viruses when people breathe or speak in enclosed spaces, producing clear and intuitive graphs.
The user can set a number of parameters, including room volume, exposure time, activity type, mask-wearing and ventilation.
The report generated by the tool indicates how to avoid exceeding critical concentrations and break chains of airborne transmission in spaces such as individual offices, meeting rooms and labs.
The tool can scientifically assess the risk for different factors like: Is there a need for filtration systems in the room?
What if a speaker at a meeting removes their mask?  This information is then used by space managers and safety officers to implement the necessary safety measures and invest in targeted technical solutions.
“Even with the vaccination campaigns in full swing in many countries, we are still seeing high numbers of positive cases and we must not forget that the virus is still out there.
CARA is an easy-to-use tool that can be pivotal in helping people return safely to social spaces,” says Benoît Delille, Head of the Occupational Health, Safety and Environmental Protection (HSE) unit at CERN.
The software is constantly being improved with the help of experts at CERN and across the world.  “CARA has a lot of potential and we are exploring its biomedical applications with other collaborators like the Institute of Global Health at the University of Geneva,” says Alessandro Raimondo from the CERN Knowledge Transfer group.
Learning from such synergetic experiences, CERN’s hope is to make the tool’s use and integration simpler and smoother in various places worldwide as part of the collective effort to take a firm stand against the pandemic.
CERN’s technologies and expertise are available for scientific and commercial purposes through a variety of technology transfer opportunities.
The CERN Knowledge Transfer group can help you tap into this potential and find solutions for you based on CERN’s many areas of expertise.

Traffic disruption expected on the route de Meyrin on 14 October due to the transportation of ATLAS detector components.
The renovation of the ATLAS experiment for the HL-LHC is proceeding, with the transportation of a New Small Wheel
The old ATLAS "Small Wheel" was transported from the Meyrin site to LHC Point 1 on Tuesday, 12 October.
Its replacement, the New Small Wheel (NSW), will make the reverse journey on Thursday, 14 October, between 8.30 and 11 a.m., in preparation for its installation in the detector in November.
This is the second and last of the NSW to make its way to the ATLAS cavern after the first one was installed this summer.
These new iconic detectors are a critical part of the upgrade of the ATLAS experiment.
Given their size and the fragility of their components, these objects, measuring nearly 10 metres in diameter, are entrusted to the company Friderici for exceptional transport.
The Geneva cantonal police as well as Geneva Public Transport have been informed of these operations, which will probably generate some traffic disruption on the route de Meyrin / RD984F due to the temporary stoppage of traffic at CERN’s Gate B intersection.
CERN Health Insurance Scheme (CHIS): flu vaccination campaign.
As part of the flu vaccination campaign organised by the Medical Service for anyone working on the CERN site, the vaccine and the vaccination will also be free of charge for the following CHIS Members: Post-compulsory Members and Subsidiary Members over 18 years of age.

Another team of two CERN scientists try to unlock the secret of the boxes provided by the primary schools.
Will Katy Foraz and Andre Henriques, engineers at CERN, be ingenious enough to study the boxes from all angles and figure out what’s inside?
After reading the notes left by Pippa Wells and Sabrina Schadegg, the first team to take up the Schools’ Challenge, it is the turn of Katy Foraz (head of the Engineering department) and Andre Henriques (mechanical engineer from the HSE unit) to conduct investigations in the CERN SM18 hall.
In June 2021, as the Be a Scientist project celebrates its 10th anniversary, pupils from Jean de la Fontaine school (Prévessin-Moëns, France) and Cérésole school (Petit-Lancy, Switzerland) have hidden various objects in two boxes and set a challenge for CERN scientists to find out what’s inside in just six months.
Historically, since 2011, the project has been introducing schoolchildren and teachers to the scientific research process.
The young researchers make hypotheses, collect data and use evidence as they set out to identify the contents of mysterious boxes without opening or damaging them.
This year, the tables have been turned.
Equipped with scales, magnets and a powerful light, Katy and Andre carried out various experiments.
They even tried to cheat with an endoscope...
Fortunately, the students are smarter and thought to seal the boxes.
Are they on the right track?
What do Mar Capeans and Tapan Nayak think?
To be continued in the next episode of the Schools’ Challenge!

Collide residency award launches new call for entries.
Arts at CERN launches a new call for Collide, its flagship residency programme, in partnership with the City of Barcelona
Today, Arts at CERN launches a new call for Collide, its flagship residency programme, in partnership with the City of Barcelona.
Artists from all around the world are invited to submit their proposals for a research-led residency.
The laureate, an individual artist or artistic collective, will be invited to spend three months dedicated to artistic research and exploration between CERN and Barcelona.
Artists interested in the dialogue between art and science can apply with a project proposal to develop during the residency working side by side with particle physicists, engineers, IT experts and laboratory staff.
The selected artist or artistic collective will receive a three-month fully funded residency award that will allow them to spend two months at CERN in Geneva, followed by one month in Barcelona where they can expand their research and engage with the scientific laboratories of the city while being hosted at Hangar Centre for Art Research and Production in Barcelona.
Arts at CERN focuses on the interactions between artists, scientists and engineers around the Laboratory’s rich culture through residency programmes, art commissions, and exhibitions.
The Collide residency programme was established in 2012 to foster networks with international organisations and create new connections between art and fundamental science worldwide.
Following last year’s successful response, the Collide Info Day on 4 November 2021 will give the opportunity to applicants to find out more about the residency award and ask questions to the Collide team of scientists, curators, and winning artists of the past edition.
“Arts at CERN is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year, and has served to strengthen the interaction and links between art and science.
Collide is an opportunity to promote the importance of fundamental research and its positive impact on society thanks to artists who offer innovative perspectives on the scientific activities and technology development here at CERN,” says Charlotte Lindberg Warakaulle, CERN Director for International Relations.
“Since 2012, Collide has brought together art and science at CERN in unique ways.
After some exceptional times for all of us, I am very happy to be able to invite artists to the Laboratory once more, and to receive ambitious artistic proposals inspired by physics and fundamental science,” declares Mónica Bello, Head of Arts at CERN.
“The success of the previous two editions of the Collide residency award and its renewal for a third year highlight the vitality of the field of art and science globally as well as in Barcelona.
Projects like Collide help support the growth and consolidation of the rich artistic ecosystem working at the intersection of science and technology, at an international level, ” says Jordi Martí, Sixth Deputy Mayor, Director of the Area of Culture, Education, Science and Community of the Barcelona City Council.
Online applications for Collide are open from 7 October until 22 November 2021.
A jury of cultural experts and scientists will select the winning artist or artistic collective who will start their residencies in 2022.

ExaHealth 2021.
On Monday, 18 October, CERN openlab and Chelonia Applied Science will host a first-of-its-kind workshop called ExaHealth 2021.
The half-day virtual event will begin at 1.00 p.m.  CEST and will examine the potential for exascale computing and machine learning to support efforts to improve public health.
The workshop is free and open to all.
With recent advancements in high-performance computing (HPC) towards exascale (the capability to perform a billion billion (1018), or a quintillion, computing operations per second) and the continued development and proliferation of both machine- and deep-learning techniques in all sectors, it is imperative that we ensure these resources are capitalised upon fully in a realm that affects us all: public health.
Projects supported by the European Union (such as Exscalate4COV and LIGATE, with the participation of dozens of institutions, including Chelonia Applied Science, hosted at the Innovation Office of the University of Basel) demonstrate the potential that exascale HPC and machine learning offer for the health sciences.
This is also seen through initiatives pioneered by CERN openlab, such as the CERN Science 4 Open Data project.
But what are we missing?
How can we ensure that we will respond quickly and efficiently to future health situations, including (but not limited to) pandemics?
Join us at ExaHealth 2021 to explore how exascale computing and machine learning are used in the health and life sciences and to begin charting a course for the future.
Full information – including a list of speakers – is available on the event page: Register by Friday, 15 October.
CERN congratulates 2021 physics Nobel Prize winners.
Syukuro Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann and Giorgio Parisi receive the prize for their groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of complex physical systems  CERN congratulates Syukuro Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann and Giorgio Parisi on the award of the Nobel Prize in physics “for groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of complex physical systems”.
Manabe and Hasselmann are recognised “for the physical modelling of Earth’s climate, quantifying variability and reliably predicting global warming” and Parisi received the prize “for the discovery of the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic to planetary scales”.
The prize recognises new techniques to describe complex systems, which are hard to understand, and predict their behaviour in the long term.
Manabe’s work laid the groundwork for the development of current climate models, and Hasselmann’s techniques have been used to demonstrate that the increased temperature in the atmosphere is caused by human emissions of carbon dioxide.
Parisi’s work meanwhile allowed the understanding and description of many different and apparently entirely random materials and phenomena, in physics, biology and beyond.
Early in his career, Parisi also made fundamental contributions to particle physics.
Together with the Italian theoretical physicist Guido Altarelli, he derived the equations that describe how the probabilities of finding quarks and gluons inside a proton change as one varies the energy with which the proton is probed.
These evolution equations are an essential element for interpreting data at accelerators, in particular from proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
Beamline for Schools: Inspiring the next generation of scientists.
The winning teams of Beamline for Schools 2021 spent two full weeks at DESY working on their experiments
The eighth edition of Beamline for Schools ended on 21 September 2021, when the two winning teams left DESY in Hamburg, Germany, with a smile on their faces and many fond memories.
The team “EXTRA” from Italy and the team “Teomitzli” from Mexico were selected from among 289 participants from all over the world and won a two-week stay in Hamburg to carry out the experiments that they had designed and to experience what it’s like to be a scientist.
Beamline for Schools usually takes place at CERN, but the competition has exceptionally moved to DESY during the long shutdown of the CERN accelerators.
This year, despite the difficulties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, both teams were able to travel to Germany to make the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
The participants, 16 students accompanied by 4 teachers, were tasked with making the best choices for their research projects, working hand in hand to successfully perform their experiments – a very enriching experience for a diverse, multicultural group.
“We learned a lot, we always had something new to discover and even if we had to work hard, we still had a lot of fun together and we truly enjoyed it.” – Luis from Mexico
“I was surprised to hear the difficulties that other scientists had to go through sometimes, and that they still loved their work and science.
One thing that we will for sure take back home is their mindset: just keep trying and be confident with what you are doing, the results will come.” – Clara from Italy
On 14 September 2021, during an unusually sunny afternoon in Hamburg, the teams presented their experiments to the national delegations, CERN and DESY representatives, and the donors who made the competition possible.
The team “EXTRA” worked on an experiment aimed at detecting X-ray transition radiation, a phenomenon that occurs when a beam of ultra-relativistic charged particles crosses the interface between media exhibiting different dielectric properties.
For this purpose, they built a component of their experimental setup and performed a series of theoretical computations that they will compare with the experimental data taken at DESY.
The Mexican team, “Teomitzli”, worked on Cherenkov radiation – light emitted when high-energy charged particles cross a dielectric medium.
Their experiment set out to compare the behaviour of different media and of light detectors, including one they developed themselves.
The teams may have left DESY, but their work is far from over.
Both groups will continue analysing the data collected at the beamline and will have the opportunity to summarise the conclusions of their work in a scientific paper.
The Beamline for Schools Competition is an education and outreach project funded by the CERN & Society Foundation, supported by individual donors, foundations and companies.
In 2021, the project was funded by the Wilhelm and Else Heraeus Foundation.
Additional contributions have been received from the Arconic Foundation, Amgen Switzerland AG, and the Ernest Solvay Fund managed by the King Baudouin Foundation.
The flu vaccination campaign has restarted.
Make your appointment and get vaccinated before 29 October
The CERN Medical Service is running its annual flu vaccination campaign during the month of October.
Vaccination is free of charge to anyone working on the CERN site.
Vaccination is taking place at various locations on the Meyrin and Prévessin sites, as well as at the ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb sites, from 4 to 29 October from 8.30 a.m. to 12.20 p.m. and 1.30 to 4.20 p.m., within the limits of available vaccine stocks and with an appointment.
Influenza – or flu, as it is more commonly known – is a viral disease family that generates a respiratory illness.
The virus attacks with more intensity during the winter months, so now is the time to act to reduce the chances of getting infected and severely ill.
The virus travels in the air in droplets when someone who is infected coughs, sneezes or talks.
You can catch the virus by inhaling it or touching a contaminated object.
People infected with the virus are most likely to infect others on the day before the first symptoms appear and for five days after they start.
To prevent the transmission of the flu virus, following the current COVID-19 guidelines is an excellent start: self-isolating and staying at home when unwell, using a mask and regular handwashing.
In addition, it is important to consider the protective effects of getting the annual flu vaccination.
Besides minimising the risk of infection and the risk of possible complications in high-risk groups, the flu vaccine also helps to prevent the spread of the virus.
To facilitate the organisation of the vaccination campaign and ensure that health and safety measures are followed, it is important to come at the exact time that you have been allocated.
In the event that you cannot make your appointment, please cancel it directly in the PLAMED portal.
For people who are not yet vaccinated against COVID-19 or are eligible for a booster shot, it is possible to have the flu and COVID-19 vaccinations at the same time at CERN’s COVID-19 vaccination centre, which has just opened.
More details are available at In case of questions, please contact the CERN Medical Service.
Computer Security: The risk of losing it all….
Ransomware and its nasty companion “extortion” attacks are still on the rise.
Criminals try to break into companies, universities and government bodies in order to demand money from the victims.
Attackers have started going big nowadays.
On the decline are the attacks à la “WannaCry” against single home user PCs; welcome instead large-scale attacks against the victim’s entire IT infrastructure!
Active Directory, file stores, databases – everything. And regardless of whether or not the victim pays, with ransomware comes the risk of losing it all…
Ransomware is not that new.
It started with malware infecting individual user PCs, encrypting all local documents, photos and files, and then asking for a little payment – the ransom – of maybe 300 dollars to get the decryption key.
Recently, however, attackers “upgraded” to the aforementioned “extortion” attacks, where data was not only encrypted but also shipped offshore, with the attacker threatening to publish all the data, private photos, personal documents and confidential files if no money was paid to them.
But the revenue was not that large and, with their expertise and skills improving, criminals turned their attention to the big fish: companies and their IT infrastructure, with ransom demands in the millions of dollars.
Their attacks, however, start slowly.  Infiltrating a company takes time, and doing it clandestinely is of the utmost importance in order to avoid getting caught.
Reconnaissance, identification of juicy assets and primary targets, deployment of malware – the process can take months.
There is also a market for the sale of corporate credentials and access to company networks.
Often, ransomware gangs don’t bother with the initial commitment involved in getting a foothold inside the company; they just buy that from other crimeware gangs.
Once their nefarious work is in place and they have exfiltrated all the sensitive data, they pull the trigger and data gets encrypted in a coordinated manner on all corporate assets in parallel.
The trigger is often at the worst possible time (during a public holiday, on a Friday evening, etc.).
They operate slowly, beneath the radar, but are determined and thorough.
Once everything is accomplished, it’s show time for the criminals and the company faces the risk of losing it all.
The three mantras of handling a ransomware attack are (1) don’t get it, (2) don’t pay, and (3) have disaster-recovery means in place.
While (1) is particularly difficult (but still mandatory and essential) given the heterogeneous infrastructure of large companies, and (2) is debatable, particularly in view of what’s at stake, (3) is the ultimate silver bullet and the last resort, in particular once the attack has already hit hard: have a proper disaster-recovery plan in place and be ready to reinstantiate your infrastructure from scratch – whether or not you pay the ransom.
The million-dollar questions for you as a CERN service manager, data taker, control system expert, trigger master, software custodian or document librarian are: Do you have the appropriate back-up means in place?
Do you have proper back-ups of your crown jewels?
Are those back-ups unaltered by and safe from attack?
Of course, it is essential, firstly, to have a back-up at all.  And to have tested whether the back-up is integral and complete and can be played back.
Back-up frequency might matter, depending on how much loss you can tolerate in the event that you need to reinstantiate your service from scratch from the last valid back-up.
The higher the frequency, the smaller the loss.
Usually, however, this frequency and the number of back-ups kept in the pipeline strongly depend on how much back-up space you have available.  Storage is not infinite.
A high back-up frequency with a limited pipeline depth might also be problematic because of the risk that encrypted files pollute the back-up (playback and testing might detect this).
Hence, secondly, can you be sure that your back-up has not been tampered with?
Given that the attackers work clandestinely over months, encrypted files – in particular if they are rarely accessed, like contracts, personal files, transaction logs and measurements – might creep into all copies of your back-up.
Ideally, back-ups should be offline (using external USB disks for individual users or tapes for big bulk back-up).
Instead of full back-ups, incremental back-ups triggered only when a file changes can counter this particular attack vector (at least until the attackers encrypt a file multiple times).
On the other hand, the malicious encryption of data files that change frequently and are regularly read back (like configuration and calibration parameters, templates, documents being worked on) should be easily spotted as accesses fail to work and functionality becomes void.
Propagation to the back-up of such encrypted files is unlikely, as the back-up period is much longer than the time before incident detection.
In the end, there are three kinds of people: (1) those who don't back up (and regret it later), (2) those who back up but don't check their back-ups (and definitely regret it later), and (3) those who back up and check their back-ups.  So, the time to check has come.
For individuals, CERNBox is the best choice.
And as a CERN service manager, data taker, control system expert, trigger master, software custodian or document librarian, check your crown jewels!
Protect your configuration, data records, calibration parameters, software libraries, documents and data!
Actually, protect CERN’s data and documents!  Talk to your IT service providers.
Figure it out.  And make disaster recovery a priority.  Otherwise, you risk to lose it all… And you might not be in a position to assume that risk for all of CERN.

CERN alumni impact society.
In just four years of existence, the CERN alumni network has grown to include over 7000 members.
The extent and reach of the network is testimony to the interest of our alumni in remaining a part of the unique CERNois community and staying connected with its mission.
This is an asset for the Laboratory and for science more broadly.
We all know that fundamental research impacts society in more ways than may be immediately obvious, through the knowledge generated and the technologies developed.
But the most immediate impact is often through its people.
CERN alumni are making their mark all around the world, across a wide range of fields and in diverse communities.
Each of them demonstrating how fundamental research – and the skills developed through science – matter, and carrying with them the values that bind the wider CERN community together: excellence, collaboration, openness and diversity.
This contribution to society of fundamental research through people is at the heart of “Second Collisions”, our second major alumni reunion, which will take place online from 1 to 3 October under the theme “Research Matters”.
Featuring virtual recreations of key sites at the Lab, the event will bring together, as speakers, alumni who are changing the face of space exploration, improving vaccine delivery, revolutionising business supply chains, innovating the future of healthcare, and much more – all building on the skills honed during their time as part of the CERN community.
All alumni and current personnel – no matter how long or short your connection with CERN – are invited to join and to meet former colleagues, play interactive games, learn about innovative new companies and explore career opportunities.
You can register at
I hope you will join us for this very special weekend to hear inspirational stories of CERN alumni and how they impact society, and to engage with alumni from across the globe.
ICTP Physics Without Frontiers welcomes Little Amal at the Esplanade des Particules at CERN.
Little Amal is a 3.5-m-tall animated puppet of a Syrian refugee girl who has embarked on a remarkable journey – an 8000-km artistic voyage that is taking her across Turkey and Europe.  To find her mother, to get back to school, to start a new life.
The little girl, a symbol of support and hope for people in exile, is taking part in more than a hundred events across Turkey, Greece, Italy, France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and the UK to focus attention on the urgent needs of young refugees.
During her journey through Europe, Amal was welcomed to Geneva on 28 and 29 September, where she made stops at the Place des Nations and the Grand Théâtre de Genève, passing by the Bains des Pâquis and the Parc des Bastions.
On 29 September between 11 a.m. and 12 (noon), Amal met representatives of Physics Without Frontiers (ICTP) at CERN before continuing her journey to Belfort, France.
Like many girls around the world, Amal dreams of becoming a scientist.
That’s why she met representatives of ICTP: the association works to motivate, train and educate physics and mathematics university students worldwide, focusing in particular on developing countries, to help build the next generation of scientists.
During her visit, Amal “interacted” with the ICTP members, who presented the actions and purpose of their association in front of an interested crowd.
Half of all refugees in the world are children.  Half of all school-age refugee children have lost their opportunity of a formal education.
Little Amal represents the thousands of children who, just like her, have fled war and persecution and need our support to rebuild their lives.
To make this possible, THE WALK has launched The Amal Fund.
The Amal Fund will support effective grassroots groups, many of them along the route Little Amal is taking.  They provide academic and vocational training, as well as essential support such as food, shelter and medical services.

LS2 Report: The new LHC collimators.
During LS2, 16 new collimators have been installed in the LHC ready for the next run and above all for the future HL-LHC
Upgrades of the LHC collimation system, which began during LS1, have continued during LS2.
Sixteen new collimators have been installed in the accelerator over the last three years in preparation not only for the accelerator’s next period of operation (Run 3) but above all for the future High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).
The HL-LHC, which is due to be commissioned at the end of 2027, will improve on the current LHC’s performance thanks to a tenfold increase in its integrated luminosity, i.e. the number of collisions per surface unit, thereby increasing the number of collisions inside the experiments.
To achieve this, the HL-LHC’s beams of particles will be more intense, which is not without its problems.
Increasing the number of particles in circulation, and therefore the number of collisions, requires the LHC’s equipment protection systems to be reinforced.
Particles that stray from their trajectory could hit sensitive components such as superconducting magnets and interfere with their operation.
Protection is particularly crucial in the vicinity of the experiments and the areas of the LHC that are dedicated to beam collimation.
That’s why the HL-LHC needs a more efficient collimation system.
The collimators, which are installed in two areas of the LHC (at Points 3 and 7 of the ring) and around the four big experiments (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb), are special devices equipped with jaws – movable blocks made of heavy-duty materials – that close around the beam to clean up the stray particles.
The materials used for these jaws are capable of withstanding extreme pressure and temperatures as well as high levels of radiation.
Some of the collimators have fixed apertures and are there to protect the magnets from radiation.
During LS2, 16 new collimators of various types have been installed in the machine.
Two TCLD (target collimator long dispersion suppressor) collimators were installed around the ALICE experiment in 2020.  The majority of the new collimators was installed in Point 7, where most of the beam “cleaning” takes place.  “We’ve installed no fewer than 14 colllimators around Point 7 during LS2.
Some have replaced existing collimators to improve them, while others are new additions,” explains Stefano Redaelli, who heads up the collimation upgrade work package for the HL-LHC project.  “I’d like to thank all the teams involved from the Accelerator and Technology sector (ATS) for their unfailing commitment – they’ve accomplished a remarkable feat!”
Three types of collimators have been installed: four primary collimators (TCPPM – target collimator primary pick-up, metallic), eight secondary collimators (TCSPM – target collimator secondary pick-up, metallic) and two fixed-aperture passive absorbers.  “The primary and secondary collimators, which were manufactured with contributions by international industrial partners, have a new design,” says Stefano Redaelli.  “They are based on a molybdenum–graphite compound that, thanks to its low electrical resistivity, helps to improve the stability of the planned higher-intensity beams.
The secondary collimators are also coated in 6 microns of pure molybdenum, which further reduces their electrical resistivity by a factor of 20.”
What’s more, these new collimators are equipped with sensors that monitor the beam position to allow the position of the jaws to be adjusted.
Two new crystal collimators, which were developed for operation with heavy ions, are also due to be installed at Point 7 at the end of this year.
We’ll report back next year with more details and the results of the first tests with beam.
A quiet revolution is under way at Prévessin.
With many developments planned or under consideration, this is the decade of CERN’s Prévessin site
From infrastructure projects to environmental and public engagement initiatives, the Prévessin site is a hive of activity that is set to escalate over the coming years.
Some, like the construction of a new Robotics building, began in 2020.
Others won’t be realised until around 2030.
Sustainable modernisation takes time and money, but CERN consistently aims for a greener future for its state-of-the-art facilities.
The developments at Prévessin rely on a collaboration and a continuous dialogue between sectors.
The inclusion of various opinions is the key to our success.
No fewer than 15 projects are planned or under consideration for the site.
The new Robotics building is nearing completion.
Its laboratories, offices and technical rooms will be open for business by October this year.
The new building will bring the activities of the Controls Electronics and Mechatronics group from the Beams department (BE-CEM) together in a single location.
CERN’s new Computer Centre, a modern and energy-efficient structure that will meet the new computing needs of the community, will also be located on the Prévessin site.
It is scheduled to be operational in the second half of 2023.
The new Building 777, at 9000 square metres, will provide new offices and labs for the Accelerators and Technology sector (ATS).
Open spaces and conference rooms have been designed for more dynamic interaction, while the landscaping will favour outdoor working spaces and an events area.
Finally, around 300 new parking spaces are planned, which will include soft mobility infrastructure, as well as a new restaurant – to everyone’s delight.
Building 777 is scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of 2026.
Buildings 904 (mostly used by the Experimental Physics (EP) department), 926 and 927 (Technology (TE) department) are also entering a consolidation phase.
Waterproofing, metalworks, collective protective equipment, smoke extraction systems and downpipes – all these structures will undergo major renovation between March and November 2022.
Prévessin’s over 7 km of beamlines and associated technical systems, in operation since the 1970s, are also earmarked for attention through the North Area (NA) consolidation project.
The NA is home to a vibrant programme of physics experiments, R&D and test beam activities, with more expected in the framework of the Physics Beyond Colliders study.
While some of the site’s beam facilities have already benefited from safety upgrades, the first phase of NA consolidation is scheduled to run until the end of Long Shutdown 3.
The fences enclosing the whole site will be consolidated, with landscaping improvements made where appropriate.
But the Prévessin development plans are not just about infrastructure.
Mobility is an important aspect that has not been overlooked in the general planning.  The importance of environmentally friendly upgrades is integral to this.
The creation in 2020 of new cycle lanes encouraging soft mobility will soon be reinforced with over 50 additional bicycle parking spaces in the parking lots of Buildings 864-866 and 947.
Charging stations for electric bikes and quick-plug (11-22kW) charging stations for electric vehicles are being studied, with a first pilot scheduled for the end of 2021.
Between 2023 and 2025, the car parks at Buildings 864-865 (ATS) and Route Touschek will be completely overhauled, with rainwater network renovation, reprofiling of the base structure and a complete redesign to meet current standards and needs.
For those who favour public transport, a new bus stop for TPG line 66 is planned at the entrance of the Prévessin site.
CERN is also working on the implementation of three other projects.  A new entrance to reflect more strongly the importance of the Prévessin site and improve its capacity to welcome visitors, a heat recovery plant from the computer centre to heat all the buildings of the Prévessin site from day one, limiting the operation of gas boilers to the few peak cold days of the year, and a new retention basin to protect local watercourses.
All in all, there’s a great deal coming up at Prévessin, and we’ll be reporting on each of these initiatives over the coming months and years.
CERN takes part in Fête de la Science in Annecy-le-Vieux.
On 5, 9 and 10 October, CERN will take part in Fête de la Science in Annecy-le-Vieux for the first time
On the Annecy campus of the University of Savoie Mont Blanc, a wide variety of stands, workshops, exhibitions and conferences are organised each year by the particle physics laboratory (LAPP), the theoretical physics laboratory (LAPTh) and the neighbouring engineering school (Polytech) on the occasion of Fête de la Science (Science Fair).
For the first time, CERN has been invited to participate and meet the people of Haute-Savoie.
On 5 October, a cinema evening will be held at La Turbine theatre: a screening of the film Particle Fever will be followed by a Q&A session where you will have the opportunity to meet scientists from CERN and LAPP.
What’s more, during the LAPP open house weekend from 9 to 10 October, CERN invites you to visit Accelerating the Future, a photography exhibition about CERN’s research, its applications in our daily life and how particle accelerators may help push the limits of human knowledge in the future.
CERN and LAPP have also prepared other surprises, such as the LHC tunnel selfie-point and the Salad Bowl Accelerator demonstration.
In addition, the Eutopia Discovery Centre will offer hands-on activities for young future scientists.
The full programme and the health and safety measures can be consulted here.
Registration for the LAPP open house weekend is open here:

Sparking the future of artificial intelligence: CERN hosts the first edition of the Sparks!
Serendipity Forum.  The first Sparks! forum is over, but you can still watch the recorded talks online  On 17–18 September, CERN held its first Sparks!
Serendipity Forum, a two-day multidisciplinary science innovation forum and public event.
The theme of the first edition of Sparks! was future intelligence – a topic relevant not only to CERN but to the rest of the world as well.
The event was divided into two parts: the Forum and the public event.
Participants from around the world joined the Forum, both virtually and in person, with the aim of sparking informal and spontaneous conversations about the topic of AI, deviating away from traditional conference formats.
The Forum consisted of group discussions around six key themes, from ethics to creativity in AI.
Participants engaged in collaborative discussions throughout the day to identify and explore questions arising from the advent of AI.
The public event was broadcast through a live webstream and watched around the world.
Bruno Giussani, Global Curator of TED, acted as host, helping to bring together influential voices from within the field of artificial intelligence.  He introduced us to important conversations around current and future trends in AI and their impact on society.
The many voices represented at the public event left no stone unturned: Can identifying the potential of AI become an existential risk to society?
What would the world look like if we had to share it with human-like robots?
Could mapping our brain help us develop better AI?
The possibility of an AI winning the Nobel Peace Prize was even considered...
Daniel Kahneman, Jaan Tallinn, Hiroshi Ishiguro, Stuart Russell, Ed Boyden and Hiroaki Kitano were among the voices exploring these topics during the public event.
You can hear all of these speakers, and more, by watching the webcast.
The public event also fused science with art, opening with a video from Ouchhh, a creative media studio, showing a simulation of proton collisions in the Large Hadron Collider, located 100 metres underground at CERN.
Made to Measure, an artistic data experiment that explores the possibility of reconstructing a person’s life based only on their online data, was presented by Hans Block, one of its creators.
If you missed the live webstream of the public event, you can watch it on the Sparks! website.
Alongside the webcast, individual videos will be created in a TED-style format and also made available on the Sparks! website.
The content of the discussions during the Forum will be published in a CERN Yellow Report and will also form the basis of a paper in the Journal of Machine Learning, to continue the important conversations surrounding future intelligence.
You can also listen to the Sparks! podcast series to hear more from some of the public event speakers.
Following on from the first edition, CERN hopes to make Sparks! an annual event, leading up to the opening of the Science Gateway in 2023.
Keep an eye out for the next Sparks! event in 2022, which will be centred around another important topic in STEM.
Sparks! is part of the CERN & Society programme.
CERN & Society activities are only possible thanks to support received from partners, in particular Rolex, which has a long-standing association with the Organization.
The 2020–2021 Sparks! event was also supported by Edmond de Rothschild, with support from the Didier et Martine Primat Foundation.
How to train your magnets.
When the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) begins Run 3 next year, operators aim to increase the energy of the proton beams to an unprecedented 6.8 TeV.
This means the thousands of superconducting magnets, whose fields direct the beams around their trajectory, need to grow accustomed to much stronger currents after a long period of inactivity during LS2.
This is done through an ongoing “magnet training” process.
Matteo Solfaroli, part of the LHC Operations group, oversees the coordination of the hardware commissioning for the LHC.
His job involves training every single chain of magnets (called a circuit), by gradually bringing them up to their nominal currents.  “This is a large project because we have about 1600 superconducting circuits in the LHC, ranging from a 60-amp nominal current to 13 kiloamps,” he says.
“These are really big circuits, and we need to test them all individually – we are talking about around 12 000 tests.”
If the magnets were not trained, the high currents would cause them to undergo a random phenomenon called “quenching”, where a small section of magnet coil overheats.
The magnets are designed to stop the coil burning away by distributing this heat across the whole magnet.
However, this results in warming up the magnet and some of its neighbours, causing them to go above critical temperature, where they are highly resistive and unable to provide the required magnetic field.
After a quench has happened, the magnet must be cooled back to cryogenic conditions before a current can be run again.
The Powering Tests team repeats the process of current increase until the magnets can withstand their nominal current without quenching.
This works because the magnets have “memory”.  “The magnet adjusts to the new current level,” Solfaroli said.
It’s a similar principle to any other sort of training: if you have ever started running, you will know that with each session you are able to run for longer without stopping – until you reach a point where you can run for a sustained period.
Muscle memory increases your endurance.  Similarly, magnet memory increases their endurance to withstand high currents for sustained periods without quenching.
The eight largest LHC dipole magnet circuits need to sustain a current of 11 500 amps.  “The problem is that the quench phenomena can happen in any of the magnets,” said Solfaroli.
“For the small circuits, quenching is not a particular problem because this is a fast recovery.
But for the main dipole circuits, the recovery time is between eight and twelve hours.”  The whole process: ramping up the current for each circuit; quenching; cooling it down and repeating is long.
Combined with all the testing and other processes, the whole magnet preparation can take eight or nine months – like training to run a marathon.
The Powering Tests team expects the magnets to be fully trained by the end of this year.
Council delegates visit new High-Luminosity LHC infrastructure.
On 23 September, 16 CERN Council delegates visited the new underground cavern at Point 1
During Long Shutdown 2 (LS2), and despite the disruption brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, CERN’s underground infrastructure saw the execution of two major civil engineering projects at Points 1 and 5 of the LHC.
These projects have successfully delivered the underground caverns and galleries required by the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).
The new HL-LHC cavern at Point 1, near the ATLAS experiment, sits at about 80 metres below the surface and is connected to a 300-metre-long service tunnel.  Measuring around 50 metres long and 15 metres wide, the cavern will host the cryogenic equipment and other accelerator systems needed for the HL-LHC.
Last Friday, 16 Council delegates took advantage of their presence at CERN for Council week to head underground.
They were joined by Director-General Fabiola Gianotti, the four directors, representatives of the HL-LHC project and support staff.
As part of the one-hour visit, the group descended via the regular lift to the underground area that leads to the LHC tunnel, where the soon-to-be upgraded inner triplet system and matching section components reside.
Some 100 metres into the LHC tunnel, a small safety gallery and five flights of stairs connect the LHC to the new structures, and via this the delegates finally reached the HL-LHC cavern, where they learned more about the site’s layout, future hardware and purpose.
“The construction of the new HL-LHC underground areas together with the successful deployment of the LHC Injectors Upgrade during LS2 are important milestones in CERN’s plans to assure our ability to deliver meaningful physics at the energy frontier for the next 15 years or so,” said Mike Lamont, Director for Accelerators and Technology.
“There’s still a lot of work to do, but in parallel with major upgrades to the LHC detectors, and with the strong support of the Member States, we’re making good progress in our mission to deliver on the vision to ensure the future exploitation of “the full physics potential of the LHC and the HL-LHC, including the study of flavour physics and the quark–gluon plasma”, as set out in the European Strategy for Particle Physics.”
CERN hosts a COVID-19 vaccination centre.
The centre opened on Monday, 27 September, in the presence of the sub-prefect for Gex and Nantua, Pascaline Boulay
Following weeks of talks and preparations, a COVID-19 vaccination centre opened on the CERN site on Monday, 27 September.
Located in Building 693, near the fire station, the centre opened its doors in the presence of the sub-prefect for Gex and Nantua, Pascaline Boulay.
Ms Boulay, the representative of the French State in the Pays de Gex, visited the centre and was welcomed by a delegation of the Management and the CERN Medical Service.  “I’m delighted with the collaboration with the French authorities that has enabled us to offer this service,” said Raphael Otzenberger, the head of the Medical Service, who explained that he and his team have been working all summer to complete the administrative formalities, prepare the premises and make the logistical arrangements for the centre to operate.
The centre is open to members of the personnel and their families, as well as retirees and contractors’ personnel.
However, as the centre is governed by French rules, only people who live in France or are French nationals are eligible for vaccination there.
The centre will administer the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty vaccine to people who have not yet been vaccinated or who qualify for a third dose.
From 4 October, it will also be possible to receive the seasonal flu vaccination at the same time as the COVID-19 vaccination, for those who wish to do so.
The centre will operate for a limited period of time and will be open on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 9.00 to 11.00 a.m. and from 2.00 to 4.30 p.m.
You can make an appointment by calling +41 22 766 7777.
Talks are in progress with the Swiss authorities to offer a similar service for people who are not French nationals and who live in Switzerland.
Until then, vaccinations are available at several centres in Geneva, some of which do not require an appointment.
More detailed information about COVID-19 vaccinations can be found on the HSE unit’s COVID-19 webpage.
CERN’s Swiss post office is moving.
As of Friday, 1 October 2021, the post office located in Building 500 on the Meyrin site will move to the Kiosk operated by Novae, opposite the current branch, which will close permanently.
The new office will take the form of a partner branch in the Kiosk, a system that eliminates certain constraints while maintaining an equivalent level of postal services and allowing customers to simultaneously access services provided by the Kiosk.
The vast majority of postal services will still be offered at the new postal branch at the Kiosk, including sending letters and parcels abroad, buying stamps and making withdrawals with the PostFinance card or payments with any debit card.
In addition, the convenient opening hours will facilitate your operations – the branch will be open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. from Monday to Friday, just like the Kiosk.
This organisational change was prompted by a continuing decline in business volume due to a shift in consumer habits towards digital transactions.
The new model of partnered branches, which exists at more than 1200 locations throughout Switzerland, will be better suited to these new practices.
The staff of the current post office will be relocated to another post office in the region.
The current CERN postal branch will remain open until Wednesday, 29 September 2021.
Online Town hall meeting on CERN Council week – Monday 11 October 2021.

CERN Director-General Fabiola Gianotti is inviting all personnel to an online information meeting on Monday 11 October 2021 from 2.00 p.m. to 3.30 p.m., to share with you the highlights of this Session, together with news from the accelerators and experiments and the latest updates on the COVID-19 response and measures at CERN.
The meeting will take place fully online, in English, with simultaneous interpretation into French.
As usual, you will be able to submit questions via a link that will be published a few days before the meeting starts on the meeting’s Indico page.
Unavailability of gas station on Prévessin site on Thursday 30 September.
Please note that the gas station on the Prévessin site will be closed on Thursday 30 September all day because of maintenance work.
The gas station on the Meyrin site is unaffected and will remain open.
We apologise for any inconvenience caused.

Pre-registration is open on Indico for the Scientific Symposium on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of hadron colliders, which will take place in the Main Auditorium at CERN on 14 October, from 2.00 to 6.00 p.m.
The event will be webcast for those unable to join in person.
The Symposium celebrates the first collisions in the world’s first hadron collider, CERN’s Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR), in January 1971 and the collider’s first results a few months later.
The ISR was the precursor to four hadron colliders built in the United States and at CERN that have enriched the sum of human knowledge and contributed to innovation in numerous ways.
As part of the Symposium, a panel of world-class speakers, including former and current CERN Directors-General and Directors and international experts in experimental physics, will review the rich history of hadron collider research and the achievements of these technological wonders.
CERN Director-General Fabiola Gianotti will close the event with a presentation on the future of hadron colliders beyond the LHC.
The full programme of the Symposium is available here.
In-person attendance of the Symposium is subject to pre-registration on Indico and to the presentation of a valid COVID certificate recognised in Switzerland.
Please note that capacity is limited and pre-registration does not guarantee entry, so please come to the auditorium only if you have received confirmation that your pre-registration has been accepted.
Professor Eliezer Rabinovici elected as next President of the CERN Council.
The CERN Council today announced the election of Professor Eliezer Rabinovici as its 24th president, for a period of one year, renewable twice, with a mandate starting on 1 January 2022
Geneva, 24 September 2021.
The CERN Council has today announced the election of Professor Eliezer Rabinovici as its 24th President, for a period of one year, renewable twice, with a mandate starting on 1 January 2022.
He will be taking over from Dr Ursula Bassler, who concludes her three-year term at the end of December 2021.
“Professor Rabinovici is a brilliant theorist in the most advanced fields of research.
During my presidency, I very often had the occasion to exchange with Professor Rabinovici, whose advice and contributions have always been very helpful to steer the ongoing discussions.
I am confident that the Council is welcoming an excellent President, whose concern for science is of the utmost importance,” said Dr Bassler.
Professor Rabinovici is currently professor at the Racah Institute of Physics of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Louis Michel visiting chair at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques (IHES).
He received his PhD in high-energy physics at the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1974.
In the following years, he worked as a research associate at Fermilab and at Lawrence Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, before returning to Israel and the Hebrew University as a senior lecturer in 1977, where he served as Director from 2005 to 2012.
Professor Rabinovici’s main field of research is theoretical high-energy physics and, in particular, quantum field theory and string theory.
He has made major contributions to the understanding of the phase structure of gauge theories, which are the building blocks of the Standard Model, and the uncovering of the phases of gravity.
Throughout his career, he has held positions within several councils and committees, such as member of the HEP-EPS Board (from 1996 to 2011), Chair of the Israeli Committee for SESAME (since 1997) and Chair of the Israeli High-Energy Committee (from 2004 to 2020).
In 2004, he was appointed as one of Israel’s delegates to the CERN Council, where he served as Vice President from 2016 to 2018.
“CERN is a special place where science and collaboration meet to answer some of the most fundamental questions about the world we live in.
Throughout my 16 years as a member of the CERN Council, I have time after time been captivated by the commitment, collaboration and knowledge of people who work together towards the same mission.
I am honoured that the Council chose me as their next President, and thankful that I get the opportunity to serve CERN’s scientific community, Member States and Associate Member States,” said Professor Rabinovici.
Grabbing magic tin by the tail.
The ISOLTRAP experiment at CERN’s ISOLDE facility has weighed the neighbouring indium nuclei of tin-100, shedding new light on this special “doubly magic” nucleus
Atomic nuclei have only two ingredients, protons and neutrons, but the relative number of these ingredients makes a radical difference in their properties.
Certain configurations of protons and neutrons, with “magic numbers” of protons or neutrons arranged into filled shells within the nucleus, are more strongly bound than others.
The rare nuclei with complete proton and neutron shells, which are termed doubly magic, exhibit particularly enhanced binding energy and are excellent test cases for studies of nuclear properties.
In a paper just published in Nature Physics, Maxime Mougeot of CERN and colleagues describe theoretical calculations and experimental results from CERN’s ISOLDE facility that shed new light on one of the most iconic doubly magic nuclei: tin-100.
With 50 protons and 50 neutrons, tin-100 is of particular interest for studies of nuclear properties because, in addition to being doubly magic, it is the heaviest nucleus comprising protons and neutrons in equal number – a feature that gives it one of the strongest beta decays, in which a positron (the antiparticle of an electron) is emitted to produce a daughter nucleus.
Studies of the beta decay of tin-100 suffer from difficulties in producing it.
Moreover, the two most recent such studies, at RIKEN in Japan by Lubos and colleagues and at GSI in Germany by Hinke and colleagues, yield different values for the energy released in the decay, resulting in discrepant values for the mass of tin-100.
Recent developments at the ISOLDE facility have enabled production of the neighbouring nuclei indium-101, indium-100 and indium-99, a mere proton below tin-100.
In their new study, Mougeot and colleagues used all of the experimental armament of the facility’s ISOLTRAP set-up to measure the masses of these new members of the ISOLDE family, notably the mass of indium-100.
“The mass of tin-100 can be derived from that of indium-100 and the energy released in the beta decay of tin-100 into indium-100,” says Mougeot, “So our indium-100 mass measurement grabbed this iconic doubly magic nucleus by the tail.”
The ISOLTRAP mass measurement of indium-100 is ninety times more precise than the previous one, magnifying the discrepancy in the values of the tin-100 mass deduced from the most recent beta-decay studies.
The researchers then made comparisons between the measured masses of the indium nuclei and new sophisticated “ab initio” theoretical calculations that attempt to describe nuclei from first principles.
These comparisons favour the beta-decay energy result of Hinke and colleagues over that of Lubos and colleagues.  Moreover, they show excellent agreement between the measurements and the calculations, giving the researchers great confidence that the calculations capture the intricate nuclear physics of tin-100 and its indium neighbours.

CERN collaborates with "100 + 1 years of international life" exhibition in Divonne-les-Bains.
The exhibition, organised by the Divonne-les-Bains authorities, traces the history of cross-border relations between the Pays de Gex and Geneva from 1920 to the present day
In 1920, Divonne-les-Bains was a small rural spa town, the Pays de Gex was farmland and Geneva was preparing to host the League of Nations.
In 2021, Divonne-les-Bains shines with its own light, the Pays de Gex has increasingly close ties with neighbouring Switzerland and Geneva has become a major hub for international cooperation.
Through documents, maps, photos, videos and interviews, this exhibition takes you on a journey through the history of cross-border relations and their impact on the local population.
As a cross-border international organisation established in the region since 1954, CERN could not be absent from this event.
Take this opportunity to find out more about local history and the CERN facilities in the area.
"100 + 1 years of international life" will be open to the public from 29 September to 24 October at the Maison du Projet de l'ÉcoQuartier de la Gare, from Wednesdays to Saturdays from 2.00 to 6.00 p.m. and on Sundays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.  On Sunday, 17 October, a guided tour "International Geneva: 100 years of architecture" will be run by the Arpadi association.
Registration required:
This exhibition, the brainchild of the Divonne-les-Bains authorities, has been made possible thanks to the support of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes Region, the Ain department, the United Nations Office at Geneva, CERN, the WTO and the associations ARPADI, Divonne Yesterday and Tomorrow, and Divonnelectro.

Environmental awareness: Recycling waste.
Let’s sort better to recycle more
In the previous article in this series, we discussed conventional waste management at CERN and raised the topic of recycling.
CERN’s recycling policy for conventional waste is based on sorting at the source.
The sorted waste is collected either regularly or on demand when the volume exceeds a certain amount.
It is then sent to various waste treatment facilities, where it is further sorted and treated.
What happens to CERN’s recycled waste?
CERN collects conventional waste in skips and bins, each dedicated to different materials.
Some of these containers (mainly scrap metal) are processed at the Recuperation and Sales service operated by the SCE department to improve sorting, while others, such as paper and cardboard, are sent directly to different recycling pathways.
Some waste, like excavation waste, is handled directly by contractors and is not included in CERN’s recycling rate.
End-of-life equipment is often sent back to the suppliers and is thus integrated in a recycling pathway adapted to the specific components.
Information on where different types of waste end up can be found here.  The entire list of materials recycled by CERN can be found here.
How many times can a typical commodity be recycled?
Most materials cannot be recycled indefinitely.
Paper, for instance, can only be recycled about ten times.
However, 1 tonne of wastepaper can produce up to 900 kilograms of recycled paper, while it takes more than 2 tonnes of wood to produce the same amount of new paper.
Some materials, on the contrary, are “infinitely recyclable”.  This is the case for glass and metals such as steel and aluminium, for example.
Although the processes may be both expensive and energy-demanding, recycling is highly beneficial for a circular economy.
For example, recycling 1 kg of aluminium saves up to 95% of the primary energy invested for its production, and thus avoids the equivalent emissions of 9 kg of CO2.
Recycling challenges for CERN
The Canton of Geneva introduced a new waste management policy in 2021, setting a target of recycling 80% of all the waste generated by companies employing over 250 employees by 2025.
The recycling rate for urban waste in the canton currently lies at 50% and the goal is to increase this to 60% by 2024.
CERN recently contracted a waste consultant to evaluate its waste management and make proposals as to how to increase the recycling rate, which amounted to 56% of total non-hazardous waste in 2018.
A particular challenge in this endeavour is to ensure proper sorting at the source.
If some cardboard or paper collected in offices is soiled – for instance by a used paper coffee cup – the whole bin is likely to be “declassified” to non-recyclable.
Therefore, CERN’s recycling performance strongly depends on the good-will and discipline of its collaborators.
CERN’s Tidy-up Week
In an effort to raise awareness of sorting recyclable materials, the Organization has launched “Tidy-up Week”, which will take place between 18 and 22 October.
Read more about this event here.
A dedicated recycling campaign for computer equipment
The SCE department has, furthermore, launched a campaign to collect broken, obsolete and unused IT equipment.
As part of the overall objective of reducing waste, the Recuperation and Sales service will either give equipment a new lease of life or recycle it properly.
Virtual CERN created for global alumni event.
The Second Collisions CERN alumni event will take place online, with participants able to explore the CERN site virtually
CERN alumni – and current personnel – are set to come together on 1–3 October for the Organization’s second major reunion.
The event, which was announced in August, will see participants roam and network within a virtual recreation of the CERN site.
Locations reinvented digitally include the Globe, the Esplanade des Particules, the Main Auditorium, Building 40, IdeaSquare and the Restaurant 1 terrace.
Participants in the event will have the opportunity to explore these places and discover captivating keynote talks, fascinating networking discussions, interactive games and virtual underground visits, as well as a range of exciting surprises.
Most importantly, participants will be able to meet one another in this virtual space – uniting people across the globe for this special one-of-a-kind event.
Like real-world conferences, the event will also feature booths showcasing a wide variety of organisations and activities.
There will be booths where participants can learn about the latest exciting developments from entities such as CERN openlab, IdeaSquare and CERN’s Knowledge Transfer group.
Some others will be run by pioneering companies, including CERN spin-offs, start-ups and established businesses.
Information on employment opportunities will also be available at the booths run by representatives of these companies.
The event has the tagline “Research Matters”. The goal is to delve into the ways in which those who have worked at CERN – as well as those working at the Laboratory today – have a positive impact upon society.
This is reflected in the line-up of exciting speakers, which features thought-leaders in space, AI, quantum computing, humanitarianism, logistics, physics, medicine and much more (see full programme below). The organisers have also lined up a series of special awards for alumni who have contributed to developing the network and supporting CERN’s mission, as well as those who have gone on to enjoy successful careers in impactful sectors.
Join us to find out their stories too.
Don’t miss out: join the hundreds already signed up for this exclusive weekend here: Register by 30 September and we’ll see you at CERN – virtually!
Computer Security: Kill that horse.
This summer, various security outfits reported on a particular nasty kind of spyware found installed on iPhone devices.
Dubbed “Pegasus”, this malware is thought to be designed by a shady security company and sold to governments and others in order to spy on journalists, activists and even politicians (like the French President).
An estimated 50 000 devices may have been targeted.
Once installed, the Pegasus malware has full access to the device and can extract contacts, emails, phone calls, switch on the microphone and the camera, etc.
Its nastiest feature, however, is its silence.
No user interaction is necessary to infect the device.
No click on a malicious link.  No opening of a malicious attachment.  No browsing to a malicious webpage.
Remember your security mantra “STOP – THINK – DON’T CLICK”?  It’s void in this particular case – a so-called “zero-click attack”.
All that’s required is for an attacker to send a well-crafted iMessage to your iPhone and the damage is done.
Compromised without any chance to protect yourself.
The only chance of spotting Pegasus in action is dedicated network monitoring: watching out for specific Pegasus-related network traffic, IP addresses and domain names.
So far, luckily for us(?), the CERN intrusion detection systems have not spotted any attacks related to Pegasus.
Fortunately, the time has come to kill that horse for good.
Apple has finally managed to release updates for its iOS iPhone operating system that are supposed to fix the initial attack vector (at least, those that we know about).
We urge you to apply those updates as soon as possible (Settings → General → Software Update).
Ideally, you already have automatic updates enabled.  Not only for your iPhone, but also for all your other devices, PCs, laptops, tablets, etc., regardless of whether you prefer Microsoft’s Windows, Linus Torvald’s Linux, Google’s Android or Steve Job’s Macbook.
Let them take care of your operating system and update your devices as soon as their most secure version is ready for deployment.

Launching Sparks!, the serendipity forum at CERN.
This week, CERN is launching Sparks!, the serendipity forum, a new two-day event aimed at stimulating creative thinking and generating new ideas relevant to CERN, and to society as a whole.
The first day brings together a group of global experts from many fields of research to share their insights into a challenge of common interest, which then feeds into a public event on day two.
It is the first of three pilots that will lead to Sparks! becoming a flagship event in the programme at Science Gateway, as part of the effort to integrate the CERN spirit of innovation across all activities at our new outreach and education centre.
For this first edition of Sparks!, the focus is on artificial intelligence (AI) examined through the perspective of experts including computer scientists, neuroscientists, philosophers, ethicists and physicists.
Each of these fields has a stake in AI, but it’s rare for all of them to meet.
What happens when they do, we’re about to find out.
The questions to explore are many and go to the heart of the challenge and the potential that AI presents for all of us.
What do we need to do to ensure that AI develops into a force for good?
Does AI need to mimic the human mind, or could a different approach be more powerful?
Will AI systems ever become self-aware?
Can they ever avoid assuming the biases of those who create them, and will they ever become cleverer than us?
Today, AI is both more mature and less mature than it appears in the public imagination.
We are far from Terminator-like cyborgs, yet AI is increasingly ubiquitous in everyday life, from voice-controlled home aids to video surveillance.
The potential for human advancement is vast, as Sparks! will expose, but, as with any new technology, we must ensure that it is used for the betterment of humankind and the sustainability of the planet.
Sparks! springs from CERN’s tradition of intellectual and technological innovation through collaboration across disciplines and geographical borders.
One of the areas where this is perhaps most evident at CERN is in the way that tools developed for the physical sciences have been deployed in the biomedical arena.
Young disciplines such as biophysics attest to the power of the kind of interdisciplinarity that Sparks! will foster.
At CERN, AI techniques are of growing importance in areas ranging from data analysis to controls and robotic maintenance.
If you’d like to know more about this, there will be a webcast talk at 5.30 p.m. on Thursday, 16 September looking at how AI is employed at CERN today.
The September/October issue of the CERN Courier also focuses on AI, and a series of Sparks! podcasts, available on the Sparks! website, give a fascinating glimpse into the thinking of some of the participants in this year’s event.
On Friday, 17 September, our assembled experts will discuss the issues surrounding AI, and their deliberations will be reported in a CERN Yellow Report and through an article in the journal Machine Learning Science and Technology.
On Saturday, 18 September, you will have the opportunity to get a preview of what those publications will say at the Sparks! public event, which will be webcast live from the Globe – see sparks.cern for details.
I hope that many of you will join us to take a privileged look at what the future holds for intelligence.
CERN acquires four new buildings for the High-Luminosity LHC.
Four buildings set to house technical infrastructure for the future accelerator were delivered to CERN by contractors between June and September
Bad news for those of us who already struggle to find our way around the maze of CERN’s buildings: four new structures have popped up this summer.
The JVMM (Joint Venture Marti Meyrin) and CIB (Consortium Implénia Baresel) consortia have handed CERN the keys of four new surface buildings intended to house infrastructure that will serve the new High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) galleries at Points 1 and 5, marking the end of “SC3” (Sectional Completion 3).
The “SF” and “SHM” buildings at Point 5, which were delivered at the end of June, are identical in every way to – and fulfil the same purpose as – the buildings bearing the same names at Point 1, which were delivered at the beginning of September.
Currently all empty, the four concrete giants will receive delivery of their first equipment (travelling cranes, doors, electricity, lighting and ventilation, etc.) in the coming weeks, and the HL-LHC infrastructure will come in a second stage.
The two SF buildings will mainly house cooling towers and primary water circulation pumps for cooling surface and underground equipment.
The SHM buildings will house the cycle compressors for the cryogenic cooling systems.
These machines compress helium from 1 bar to just over 20 bars (successive expansions of this compressed helium in the cold box then produce the cold needed to cool the underground systems).
Even though they are empty, the new buildings already have certain unique characteristics.
The floors of the two SHM are entirely coated with waterproof resin, preventing any environmental contamination by potential leaks of the compressor lubricant oil.
In addition, the walls are soundproofed to protect our ears from the compressors’ droning, which can reach 105 decibels.
The four buildings, two on each of the CERN sites, are located at either end of their future respective gallery chains, via which they will be connected to the SU, SD and SE service buildings, themselves connected to underground galleries.
The galleries will be delivered as part of “SC5”, scheduled for the end of 2022, which will bring the HL-LHC project’s major civil engineering work to a close.
With SC3 out of the way, that’s the next focus for many of the teams involved in these mammoth undertakings (the SCE-PPM group’s civil engineering team, contractors and design offices).
While the scale of the SC3 buildings may seem small compared to that of the vast underground galleries, building them on schedule is nevertheless a crucial milestone in the HL-LHC project.
Geothermal survey starting soon on the CERN sites.
Since 13 September, the State of Geneva and the Services industriels de Genève (SIG) have been conducting a geothermal exploration survey.
Geophysical measurements are being taken throughout Geneva Canton and neighbouring France, including on the CERN sites.
The aim is to map the subsurface in order to confirm its geothermal potential.
Vibroseis trucks will spend six weeks criss-crossing the area.  CERN has agreed for the measurements to be carried out on its sites during the nights of 18 to 20 September.
Sound waves will be sent from the surface into the ground every 30 metres and will propagate through the zone being measured.
Their echo through the geological layers will be recorded by sensors, enabling the geologists to produce a 3D image of the characteristics of the subsurface.
This data collection and the resulting mapping are essential for both Geneva Canton and CERN, and will directly benefit many civil engineering projects, such as the Future Circular Collider (FCC).
The trucks' measurement points have been carefully chosen and agreed in advance and are indicated in orange on the site map (yellow dots = geophone locations; dots inside circles = soundwave application points rejected by the Organization).
Each orange dot shows where a truck will stop and apply vibrations for one minute.
The survey will cause minimal disturbance, as the vibroseis trucks are equipped with a new technology that reduces the noise and intensity of the vibrations that can be felt.
A launch pad for the next generation of technical entrepreneurs.
From energy storage solutions to optimised car trailers, students pitched their start-up ideas on a wide range of fascinating topics during the 2021 edition of the CERN Entrepreneurship Student Programme
On 27 August 2021, the CERN Entrepreneurship Student Programme (CESP) held its Demo Day, during which participating teams marked the completion of the intensive five-week entrepreneurial programme by delivering their final venture idea pitches.
This year marked CESP’s fourth run, in which five selected teams of technical master’s students from across the globe got a chance to work on and build their start-up ideas.
Organised by CERN’s Knowledge Transfer group, since 2018 the competitive programme has helped 40 students develop their entrepreneurial skills through coaching from technology and business experts.
This year’s programme was held online due to the global health situation.
Students joined in virtually from Canada, India, Mexico, North Macedonia and the United Kingdom, and developed five promising projects with the potential of becoming start-up companies in the future.
“We had only worked on the technical side of our project before joining.
Thanks to CESP, we had a solid venture idea to pitch in just five weeks – I found it hard to believe!
Thanks to the close mentorship and insightful lectures, we set and reached quite ambitious and specific goals each week.”
Maja Sharevska, CESP 2021 participant
On Demo Day, all the teams presented their final pitches covering a diverse range of topics: apps for the general public to contribute to science challenges, solutions for efficient energy storage, a platform to make getting job experience easier for college students, performance car trailers to facilitate transport, and even an oxygen-optimisation device intended to alleviate the acute oxygen supply crisis that many countries are facing because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The teams were met with enthusiastic feedback, and they deftly fielded probing questions from the attending tech and business experts, including programme sponsor Jasper Van Zon from the Arconic Foundation.
For an in-depth look at their ideas, watch the Demo Day recording here.
“Working remotely and together with scientific and tech entrepreneurs from all over the world showed us the importance of exchanging knowledge.”
Adolfo A. Romero, CESP 2021 participant
Since CESP’s launch in 2018, the idea behind the programme has been to train the next generation of technical entrepreneurs and help them solve global challenges.
Students draw on the wide range of technologies and competences offered at CERN to tackle a problem they have identified and wish to address through their business idea.
In 2021, CESP was supported by the CERN & Society Foundation thanks to a generous donation by the Arconic Foundation.
The highly competitive programme will be organised again in 2022.
Applications for next year’s edition will open in 2022.

Environmental awareness: Participate in CERN’s “Tidy-up Week”.
Tidy up your work environment with a focus on recycling materials and waste
On 18 September, people in 180 countries worldwide will engage in the World Clean-up Day, an annual social action with the objective of tackling the global waste problem.
CERN will contribute to this effort through its “Tidy-up Week”, aimed at raising awareness about the need to reduce waste and properly sort recyclable materials.
CERN’s “Tidy-up Week” will take place between 18 and 22 October 2021. This first pilot edition will concern the following buildings: 5, 23, 24, 31, 54, 57, 73, 93, 104, 193, 288, 513, 561, 865 and 904.
The event is carried out in collaboration with the respective Departmental Safety Officers (DSO) and Territorial Safety Officers (TSO).
What will be happening?
People working in the buildings concerned are invited to identify and sort equipment and material that they no longer need in their offices, workshops or laboratories.
This includes paper, metal, wood, glass and office furniture.
Please keep in mind the three Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) of waste management.
The full list of recyclable materials can be found here.
How does it work?
In the weeks prior to the event, our experts will help the occupants of the buildings concerned to identify and label the waste and decide on the appropriate action (storage, reuse, recycling, etc.).
The date of the visit for each building will be indicated on the dedicated webpage.
During the week of the event, skips and containers will be placed near the buildings concerned for the disposal of equipment and materials.
A transport team will be available to help remove the more voluminous objects.
In this case, a transport request needs to be filled in beforehand (the procedure is outlined on the dedicated webpage).
And if your building isn't on the list?
This event is a pilot, and more buildings will follow in the future.
If you’re interested in joining the effort, please contact the coordination group at
Specific collection of IT equipment
In addition to this event, an ongoing campaign is being organised for the collection of IT equipment.

Details on previous topics are available on the Nine pages (restricted to senior staff).
5-yearly review: an important milestone.
Since the last Bulletin update in February, an important milestone was passed in the context of the five-yearly review1 (5YR) when the conclusions of key documents were presented at the Tripartite Employment Conditions Forum on 28 May 2021.
Following the methodology set out in Annex A1 of the Staff Rules and Regulations, studies and surveys of the financial and social conditions of CERN personnel have been undertaken to ascertain, firstly, whether the Organization remains an attractive employer for Staff and Fellows from all CERN’s Member and Associate Member States and, secondly, whether it is able to offer adequate conditions to Associated Members of Personnel (MPAs) coming to work for limited periods in its research facilities.
Staff salary studies are a mandatory part of the 5YR and are preceded by an analysis of CERN’s main recruitment markets over the past five years.
As provided for by the Annex A1 methodology, these studies involve benchmarking ‘local’ and ‘international’ salaries in order to compare CERN salaries, through a representative sample of benchmark jobs across all grades, with the respective local2 and international markets.
The local salary survey, covering grades 1 to 3, was performed by a local consultant and concluded that the companies offering the most competitive salaries are located in Geneva and Vaud, where salaries are, on average, 8% below CERN’s reference salaries.
The international salary survey, covering grades 4 to 10, was performed by the International Service for Remunerations and Pensions (ISRP), which is administratively attached to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
An analysis conducted by the HR department in preparation of the 5YR in 2020 identified the high-technology private sector as CERN’s main recruitment market.
The ISRP then identified Switzerland and Germany as the CERN Member States offering the most competitive salaries in that domain.
The main conclusion of the ISRP survey is that, overall, salaries in the Swiss high-technology market are approximately 9% above CERN salaries, whereas CERN is approximately 5% above the German high-technology market.
Given the breadth and diversity of the salary surveys and of the process in general, the HR department has compiled a dedicated webpage3 to guide and inform you on the details and conclusions of this key aspect of the 5YR.
Fellows’ stipends were compared with similar graduate programmes at ESA, ESO, the European Commission, DESY and EMBL.
The analysis concluded that the conditions offered by CERN continue to be attractive, and are indeed somewhat higher than those paid by the comparator organisations.
For MPAs, the subsistence allowances have been consistently indexed to the cost of living in the local region.
Finally, the ISRP was mandated to conduct a diversity and inclusion benchmarking survey of CERN and eight other organisations: EMBL, EPO, ESO, ESA, EC, ITER, UNOG and OPCW.
The findings of this survey, covering topics such as contract type, age, family, gender diversity, spouse employment, teleworking and disability measures, were presented to TREF in March.
The report showed that CERN is doing very well in certain areas, such as childcare and some of the diversity-related policies stemming from the previous 5YR, but identified other areas where further improvement is desirable, such as gender diversity, the telework framework, flexible working hours, co-parenting leave and dual-career opportunities.
The Management, in collaboration with the Staff Association, is fully committed to following up on the results of this survey to ensure that diversity and inclusion are not limited to actions once every five years, but are under continuous review.
As we enter the final stages of the 5YR process, based on the aforementioned analyses and the corresponding conclusions, the Management’s proposals are now under preparation, in concertation with the Staff Association, and will be submitted to TREF in October and to the Council for approval in December.
As this extensive exercise nears completion, we will be sure to report back to you on the latest developments.

Give your IT equipment a second life and reduce waste.
18 September is World Clean-up Day.  This is the perfect opportunity to join the ongoing SCE recycling campaign and to take action on waste by respecting the three Rs: reduce, reuse, recycle.
The Storage, Recuperation and Sales service, part of the Site and Civil Engineering (SCE) department, is running a campaign to collect broken, obsolete or unused IT equipment.
As part of the overall objective of reducing waste, the service will either give them a new lease of life or recycle them properly.
Whether you choose to seize the opportunity of World Clean-up Day, or indeed of “Tidy-up Week”, to sort out your desk drawers or you prefer to wait for a more convenient date, remember that computer equipment that is no longer in use should be recycled.
Simply bring your no-longer-used computer, IT equipment (workstations, laptops, mice, smartphones, screens, peripherals, batteries, cables, hardware, etc.) or printers, regardless of their condition, to Building 133.
You can also contact the Storage, Recuperation and Sales service or your group secretary to find out who is the departmental contact person who can help you dispose of your old equipment.
Having a sort-out is good for the mind and promotes well-being.
Recycling is good for the planet and our future.
Computer equipment recycling and refurbishing is an important part of our Organization’s sustainable waste strategy.
Thanks to this campaign, no-longer-used equipment will be properly wiped and recycled, or potentially repaired and reused.
Get involved!
Two CERN scientists give the primary schools’ challenge a go.
Used to making precise measurements, will Pippa Wells and Sabrina Schadegg be able to figure out what’s inside the mysterious boxes?
Since 2011, schools from Geneva, the Pays de Gex and Haute-Savoie have been receiving strange mystery boxes from CERN.
The pupils, aged between 8 and 12, make hypotheses, collect data and use evidence as they set out to identify the contents of the boxes without opening or damaging them.
As the Be a Scientist project celebrates its 10th anniversary, the tables have been turned, as primary-school pupils set a challenge for CERN – and the clock is ticking!
In the utmost secrecy, pupils from Jean de la Fontaine school (Prévessin-Moëns, France) and Cérésole school (Petit-Lancy, Switzerland) have hidden various objects in two boxes that, they hope, will flummox the scientists and keep them busy for the next six months!
After receiving the boxes, Pippa Wells (Deputy Director for Research and Computing) and Sabrina Schadegg (environmental engineer) started their investigations in the radiation protection calibration laboratory of CERN’s HSE unit in Prévessin-Moëns.
While they didn’t identify any particular smells, they did hear some intriguing sounds.
Moreover, the French box lost 23 grams in two weeks!
What could have evaporated?
Something containing water?
Maybe Katy Foraz and Andre Henriques will discover what it is in the next episode of the Schools’ challenge!
Pippa and Sabrina receive mystery boxes and start investigating (Video: CERN)

“Lightning talks” bring CERN openlab’s first-ever full online summer-student programme to a close.
Participants of the 2021 CERN openlab summer-student programme presented their fascinating work in a series of five-minute talks
The 2021 CERN openlab summer students presented their creative and inspiring work in a series of five-minute “lightning talks” held on 6 and 7 September.
Each year, CERN openlab runs its summer-student programme over nine weeks from July to September.
Students from across the globe work on innovative IT projects, guided by experts at CERN.
Thanks to the companies participating in the CERN openlab public–private partnership, the students work hands-on with cutting-edge computing technologies.
Today, the participating companies are as follows: Intel, Oracle, Siemens, Micron, Google, be ys Research, IBM, E4 Computer Engineering, Cambridge Quantum Computing, Comtrade and Open Systems (in addition to CERN openlab’s research members).
This year, the students’ projects addressed challenges related to quantum computing, cloud, machine learning, high-performance computing and much more.
All the work for this year’s programme was carried out remotely because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Nevertheless, CERN openlab was still able to offer the usual programme of exciting lectures from IT experts at CERN.
Recordings of all the lectures are now available online and are free to view.
Some 27 students from 15 countries participated in this year’s programme.  “Working with CERN openlab has been an invaluable experience,” says Mehant Kammakomati, a student at NIT Andhra Pradesh in India.
“Collaborating remotely across continents has been very enriching.”
The students also took part in virtual visits of different parts of the Laboratory.
In addition, many of the students participated in the CERN Webfest, an online hackathon held in August.
Mehdi Golbaz, a CERN openlab summer student from India, was a member of the winning team at the Webfest.
He and his colleagues combined crowdsourced design and 3D printing to create tools to help people with disabilities.
While a wide range of activities and lectures are on offer, the students’ projects remain the core of the programme.
The lightning talks always provide an excellent overview of the hard work carried out by the students.  This year was no different: across the two days, participants at the event learned about the challenges faced by the students and the innovative solutions they dreamed up to overcome them.
The members of the CERN openlab management team were impressed by the high quality of the presentations.
Together, they highlighted the following five projects as particularly meritorious:
Quantum-computing simulation benchmarks by Samuel Gonzalez Castillo A data lake as a service for open science by Muhammad Aditya Hilmy Deep Learning techniques for signal processing and event reconstruction at DUNE by Laura Accorto Accelerating high-energy physics workloads using Kubernetes by Jason Praful Francis Xavier Unveiling new capabilities of the Oracle RESTFUL Data Services: GraalVM, third-party authentication systems and integration with modern development frameworks by Marcel Ochsendorf.
These students will each receive a small package of CERN-themed prizes in recognition of their excellent presentations.
“Working for a world-class research organisation like CERN enabled me to hone both my analytical and creative skills,” says Rodrigo Bermúdez Schettino, a student at Technische Universität Berlin, Germany.
“It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, which I’ll remember forever.”
“Training the IT specialists of the future is a key component of CERN openlab’s mission,” says Enrica Porcari, CERN IT Department Head.
"Despite the challenges of working remotely, the students have forged important relationships – including friendships – that they will surely treasure for years to come.
These connections will also serve them well in their fledgling careers, on their journeys to becoming the leading IT experts of the future."
Video recordings of the students’ lightning talks are available on the event pages: session 1; session 2.

Seeing Sparks!: CERN’s first serendipity forum on future intelligence.
The upcoming first edition of Sparks!, which will be held 17-18 September, adopts the theme of future intelligence
The upcoming first edition of Sparks!, which will be held 17-18 September, adopts the theme of future intelligence, and paves the way for two more pilot events in the lead up towards CERN’s new Science Gateway, opening in 2023.
The public event on 18 September will be available to watch through the live webstream from 16:00 - 20:00 CET.
Visit the Sparks! event website for more information.
Sparks! the serendipity forum is a two-day multidisciplinary science innovation event organised by CERN.
Sparks! aims to create a platform to drive innovation on topics relating to science, technology, engineering and maths, reflecting on their relevance in society and how to collaborate to address them.
The event consists of a forum and a public event.
The forum will bring together 50 global experts, from scientists and ethicists, to philosophers and psychologists, to provoke discussions around the future of artificial intelligence, and what this means for society.
The engagement in the forum will form the content of the public day, which will include short talks and discussions on the topic of future intelligence.
Sparks! will also share information and generate debate through various platforms such as the podcasts and videos of the launch already published, in addition to articles and other academic materials.
The public event will be accessible for everyone to watch through the live webstream.
The impact of AI, now and in the future, is experienced on a global scale.
The theme of future intelligence demonstrates the benefits AI has for CERN, but also highlights the wider impact on global society and the challenges that it brings.
Charlotte Warakaulle, Director for International Relations, explains the idea behind Sparks!:
“We want to bring CERN’s spirit of intellectual and practical innovation to the cutting edge themes in science, technology, engineering and maths.
The idea is to focus on areas that are important for CERN as a research laboratory and to everyone as citizens - and artificial intelligence is an example of this.
It is an opportunity for us as a scientific community to learn and also engage with society on the challenges we face globally.  We believe that pooling ideas and working across boundaries is essential to finding good solutions. ”
The Sparks! public event will hear from some of the most prominent names in artificial intelligence.
The lineup includes Daniel Kahneman, discussing the psychology of decision making, deep-learning expert and director of machine learning at NVIDIA, Anima Anandkumar, Koray Kavukcuoglu from DeepMind, Hiroaki Kitano, CEO of Sony AI Inc., and Jaan Tallinn, founding engineer of Skype and founder of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, among many others.
Sparks! is part of the CERN & Society programme.
CERN & Society activities are only possible thanks to support received from partners, in particular Rolex and its long-standing association with the organisation.
The 2020-2021 Sparks! event is also supported by Edmond de Rothschild, with support from the Didier et Martine Primat Foundation.

CERN participates in the exhibition “From Geneva to the World”.
The exhibition, organised by the Permanent Delegation of the European Union to the United Nations Office, pays tribute to the work of Geneva-based multilateral institutions and the benefit they bring to people across the world
Multilateralism is a word you hear a lot in Geneva, but let us not forget its meaning – it conveys the idea of international cooperation in today’s interconnected world.
The challenges we face – from climate change to global health – show that this cooperation between states is more important than ever.
The Delegation of the European Union to the United Nations Office in Geneva has installed a photo exhibition on the benefits that organisations that uphold this value of cooperation bring to the world, in partnership with the UN and the City of Geneva.
It is an opportunity for over 30 international organisations, including CERN, to show the impact of their work in Geneva on citizens around the globe.
You can visit the free exhibition on the Quai Wilson, between the Bains des Pâquis and the Parc de la Perle du Lac, throughout September.
The inauguration took place on 6 September 2021, with opening remarks by EU Ambassador Lotte Knudsen, High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, WIPO Director-General Daren Tang and Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees Kelly Clements.
Researchers use CERN technology to evaluate risk of COVID-19 transmission.
The CERN-developed COVID Airborne Risk Assessment tool (CARA) is helping researchers from the University of Geneva assess the effectiveness of different measures to limit SARS-CoV-2 aerosol transmission in schools
Having good safety measures at schools is very important as children start going back to the classroom.
But which measures are most effective at optimising health and safety conditions and preventing the spread of COVID-19 in school settings?
In a new study, researchers from various institutes including the Institute of Global Health (IGH) at the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and CERN used the CARA tool to model the concentration profiles of potential airborne viruses in a classroom of 160 m3 containing one infectious individual.
A comprehensive analysis was conducted in order to find optimal solutions in different scenarios.
It found, for instance, that natural ventilation – while a necessary measure – is more effective in winter than in summer.
“Our results show natural ventilation by opening windows, face masks and HEPA filtration to be most effective, when used in combination and complemented by additional measures like physical distancing, contact tracing and vaccination,” says the IGH’s Olivia Keiser, one of the researchers in the study, who has also participated in the Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force.
CARA was initially used at CERN to inform space-management decisions on the CERN sites.
“CARA is an easy-to-use tool, which CERN has made openly available.
The original idea of CARA came from wanting to investigate the risks of working in shared spaces.
Over time, the tool was further optimised thanks to the expertise of different departments at CERN and with the help of worldwide experts in infectious diseases,” says Andre Henriques, head developer of CARA from the Occupational Health and Safety and Environmental Protection (HSE) unit at CERN.
CERN’s know-how was key in developing the physical model of CARA, but with institutes like IGH bringing their extensive expertise in epidemiology and public health to the table, it is possible to exploit the potential of the tool for wider applications.
“With CERN’s technological expertise and our experience in health studies, the results from the study will be highly useful in deciding on targeted technical solutions that can help balance safety with a better school going experience,” says Jennifer Villers, an MSc student at UNIGE and the main author of the study.
Besides its use in primary and secondary education settings, the CARA tool has further knowledge-transfer potential and can also be used to assess the effectiveness of mitigation measures in other settings, such as higher education institutions and other indoor spaces.
This article was also published on the website of the CERN Knowledge Transfer group here.
CERN’s technologies and expertise are available for scientific and commercial purposes through a variety of technology transfer opportunities.
The CERN Knowledge Transfer group can help you tap into this potential and find solutions for you based on CERN’s many areas of expertise.

Computer Security: Privacy vs security – a double dilemma.
In this increasingly digitalised world, privacy was initially neglected for some time, but is now gathering speed.
The internet was the no-privacy Wild West, with big social media outlets, advertising companies and government agencies trying to gather whatever was legally (and sometimes even illegally) possible.
People, however, are becoming more and more aware of the privacy implications of using the internet and, fortunately, tools do exist to improve the privacy of online browsing.
With such tools in place, however, it also becomes more and more difficult to protect an organisation like CERN against remote attacks and user blunder. –
Privacy is important.
The amount of data that online giants have collected about us is staggering.
Standard web browsing is, by design, leaving traces (you can check these traces on sites like – best with sound on).
Embedded “like” buttons and similar third party content make it possible to gather even more information.
And even if you have enabled browser privacy add-ons like “Ghostery”, “Privacy Badger”, “uBlock”, “DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials”, etc., certain of your computer’s parameters and features (operating system, time zone, local language, screen size and color depth, fonts, browser plugins, touch support) still provide sufficient entropy to identify your device among millions of others (check out yours).
In a particularly frightening example, an activist group was able to reconstruct the life of a volunteer based only on her Google-stored search history and metadata.
In order to protect your privacy, the use of so-called “secured” protocols like HTTPS, SSH and VPN help in shielding all your communication from eavesdropping by third parties.
In addition, Mozilla, Apple and others have proposed and implemented new and more sophisticated (but also intrusive) measures to stop people spying on your network traffic:
Mozilla, in collaboration with Cloudflare, provides a browser option to funnel all your DNS requests, i.e. the task of resolving an IP address to a domain name and vice versa, via HTTPS to their DNS servers (“DNS-over-HTTPS” or, for short, “DoH”) instead of using local ones.  Google offers the same through their 8.8.8.8 DNS resolver.
This prevents third parties (other than Cloudflare or Google, of course) collecting the domain names your device wanted to access.
Some other companies have started to randomise so-called MAC addresses, i.e. the normally unique IDs of every device.
These “Private Wi-Fi addresses” (term used by Apple) hinder Wi-Fi infrastructure providers’ efforts to trace a device, as the unique identifier is now randomised and varies often.
Just recently, Apple introduced “iCloud Private Relay”, which spawns a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to Apple’s servers in order to hide local IP addresses and stop any traffic being exposed to third parties.
Dilemma 1.  You face a dilemma, however, as DoH, VPN, and “iCloud Private Relay” might not work when connecting to CERN-internal services, as those measures tunnel to outside CERN.
Similarly when using “Private Wi-Fi addresses”, as by changing quickly they prevent your device from connecting to CERN’s Wi-Fi network.
The CERN Wi-Fi network requires a permanent, fixed MAC address (hence, please disable this feature in the Wi-Fi settings for the CERN network (“CERN SSID”)).
Dilemma 2.  The CERN Computer Security team faces a dilemma, too.
While we value your privacy, all of these privacy measures hinder our efforts to do our job, namely to protect the Organization and to protect your devices against any kind of cyberattack.
With secured channels – HTTPS, VPN, DoH – we are less able to detect whether your device is connecting to some malicious domains, being redirected to spooky websites or downloading data with dangerous contents.
And being blind conflicts directly with our objective to keep your device, and the Organization, secure.
Hence, while we continue to encourage you to use HTTPS, SSH and VPN (as a client at CERN; see also our Bulletin articles on VPN tunnels, “Tunnel Madness”), please refrain from using DoH and Apple’s “iCloud Private Relay” while on the CERN network for the sake of the general protection of the network and its attached devices.
If this does not work, we will have to consider blocking these features (but would first need to better understand the collateral damage), and we prefer not to.

Operational Circular No. 7 (Rev. 2) – Telework.
Operational Circular No. 7 (Rev. 2) entitled "Telework", approved by the Director-General, is now available via the following link.
This revision cancels and replaces Operational Circular No. 7 (Rev. 1) entitled "Telework” dated November 2016.
This circular is an evolution of our current framework, incorporating lessons learned from the COVID‑19 pandemic and implementing the principles endorsed at the Extended Directorate of 9 March 2021, which simplify, streamline and increase flexibility whilst maintaining the focus of work on the CERN site.
The main modifications are:
The introduction of telework opportunities also for Associated Members of the Personnel; The setting up of one single procedure for both regular and occasional telework; The introduction of a new general limit for telework of 40% of the contractual working time, in any two-week period.
The revised Circular will enter into force on 1 September 2021 and will be implemented taking into account the COVID 19 measures in place (
Members of the personnel are invited to consult the CERN Admin e-guide for more details on implementation, including an FAQ and support for supervisors, at link.
The BRIL luminosity sub-detectors prepare CMS for a bright Run 3.
Calabrese, Capricciosa, Diavola and Margherita – the four modules of the BRIL sub-system – were mounted on the CMS experiment in July 2021
After long months of preparation, the Beam Radiation, Instrumentation and Luminosity (BRIL) group has completed the installation of three instruments dedicated to the measurement of luminosity and beam conditions: the Beam Condition Monitor “Fast” (BCM1F), the Beam Condition Monitor for Losses (BCM1L) and the Pixel Luminosity Telescope (PLT).
These three of the BRIL sub-detectors make up the BRIL sub-system which is segmented into 4 modules.
They represent a new “generation” in their respective design history.
Both PLT and BCM1F rely on silicon sensors, while BCM1L uses poly-crystalline diamond sensors.
Measuring the real-time rate of collisions at CMS is key to optimising both the trigger rates and the quality of the beams delivered by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
Continuously assessing the beam conditions is also essential to the protection of the LHC machine and the sensitive CMS sub-detectors.
Finally, the aggregated luminosity measurements need to be meticulously understood to determine the expected frequency of interactions in the analysis of data collected at CMS.
The design and production of new components, sensor characterisation, assembly, stress-testing under thermal cycles, troubleshooting, repairs and other tasks spanned a few years of challenging work, which ramped up as Long Shutdown 2 came to a close.
The transport activities began before sunrise on 5 July 2021.
Each module of the sub-system was carefully loaded onto a special transport vehicle and dry air was circulated inside their transport boxes.
Only days before, each module had been delicately readied for its journey, which included labelling them with their affectionately selected aliases: Calabrese, Capricciosa, Diavola and Margherita.
After being lowered down the pit to the CMS experimental cavern, each module was craned up to the tracker sub-detector platform.
The BRIL sub-detectors now lie at the heart of the CMS detector, about 1.8 m from the interaction point, just beside the forward pixel tracking sub-detector.
One of the most significant changes in the design of the instruments has been the implementation of a new active cooling circuit for BCM1F, which is essential for a silicon-based detector.
The PLT cooling loop has been modified to include a new section for BCM1F.
The design of the BCM1F cooling circuit follows the approach implemented for the PLT during Run 2: the cooling structure has been 3D printed in a titanium alloy using the selective laser melting technique.
The silicon sensors used for BCM1F and three of those used in one of the PLT channels were sourced from a batch currently being developed for the CMS Phase II upgrade for the High-Luminosity LHC.  “This is the first time that these prototype Phase II silicon pixel sensors will be installed in CMS, so the whole community is eager to see how this material behaves,” says Anne Dabrowski, CMS BRIL project manager.
The installation of the BRIL sub-detectors was closely followed by the sealing of the bulkhead, which encloses them with the CMS silicon pixel and strip tracker sub-detectors.
The work is now focused on the full commissioning of all BRIL systems in anticipation of the first beams of Run 3 of the LHC.
This story was originally published on the CMS website.
A reminder of the COVID-19 measures in place.
Our capacity to tackle COVID-19 depends on the efforts of everyone
As the summer holidays come to an end and school classes resume, it’s a good time to remind ourselves of the measures in place to protect us all from COVID-19.
Huge progress has been made since the pandemic began, allowing measures to be relaxed to some extent, in a way that recognises that the virus that is still with us.
CERN’s approach to handling the pandemic has been, unsurprisingly, driven by science.
The range of measures we have applied from the start has been very diverse and based on the evidence available at the time.
We’ve continuously monitored the facts, and adjusted our measures accordingly.
For much of the pandemic, CERN’s measures have been stricter than those of the Host States, and when we have relaxed them, we have done so only after a thorough analysis of the prevailing conditions in the region, or because the growing body of epidemiological evidence has allowed us to do so.
For example, when studies appeared indicating that distancing of 1.5 metres is as safe as 2 metres, we relaxed that requirement.
In parallel to the application of now well-known measures, we’ve developed tools, like CARA, that help us to assess the level of risk in shared spaces, and apply appropriate preventative measures.
CARA has also raised much interest outside CERN, and its use has been deployed by other organisations.
CARA has contributed to a number of academic papers, and allowed CERN to be part of a working group convened by the WHO with the aim of developing an algorithm and methodology to quantify airborne risk transmission.
We are also trialling the use of CO2 monitors as a means to verify the quality and renewal of air, and to help substantiate the results of the CARA tool.
This summer we moved our COVID level to 2 – Yellow, allowing people to come back on site.
Throughout the summer, the overall number of people coming on site has remained stable at around 4500 people per day, just slightly higher than when CERN was at level 3 – Orange.
Throughout this period, the positivity rate has remained low among the CERN community, and in line with the rate in the local region.
Many of those coming back on site were grateful of the opportunity to see colleagues in the flesh, instead of on zoom.
For those who are vulnerable or are uncomfortable about coming on site, flexibility has been the key word, along with specific protection plans where appropriate.
Many of us, naturally, keep a close eye on the incidence rate.
It is an important factor in determining which level CERN applies, but it is just one factor out of many.
We have also taken into account factors including the conditions applying in the Host States, the strong evidence concerning the impact of vaccination programmes, the spread of new variants, the capacity of the site and the desire of many to come back on site under safe conditions.
Our approach going forward is to acknowledge that the virus will be with us for some considerable time, and to keep CERN as open as possible in this new normality while maintaining strict measures to safeguard everyone’s health.
For that reason, we strongly encourage vaccination, coupled with regular testing provided free of charge to everyone on site, the application of health and safety measures and the mandatory use of Proximeters while on site.
This approach allows us to keep coming on site, and to prevent spread by identifying those carrying the virus, and those they have been in contact with.
Keeping the community informed through the regular COVID-19 emails is an important part of CERN’s approach.
These mails not only include information necessary for us all to carry out our work, and live our daily lives in both Host States, but also links to some of the studies that guide our actions as the situation and our knowledge of the virus evolve.
Success relies on everyone making an effort: read the regular COVID-19 emails carefully, get vaccinated if you can, if you are coming on site, test regularly, respect the measures in place, and do not come on site if you have even the most minor symptoms.
We are all looking forward to a return to normality, although things will never be quite as they were before, and it requires all of us to get there.
